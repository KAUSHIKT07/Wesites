Elizabeth and her scientist friends were going to begin excavations of an ancient city on the island of Pemba close to Zanzibar. Elizabeth was very excited about the work they were about to undertake. Zanzibar had been along important trade routes for centuries and she was hoping they could have an exhibition of their findings after a year or so. Elizabeth\'s team did exemplary work. They were excavating in the vicinity of Kizimkazi. The team found several interesting items, among them were statues dressed in clothes with a zigzag pattern, strange tablets with patterns of lines and zeros, remnants of huge quantities of maize husks and extremely flexible tent poles. The most amazing and bizarre discovery was a dazzling bronze construction of several dozen chimpanzees climbing up a tree. The tree had long since fallen but had been well preserved in mud. Perhaps the tablets with lines and zeros are even more puzzling. Could ancient societies living on Pemba have had advanced knowledge about, for example, the galaxy? Now, a decade later, sitting in her jazzy garden, the breeze infused with the scent of azaleas, Elizabeth looks back at this expedition with fond memories and still ponders the questions presented by the tablets.

(70, 70, 1, 'The Gulf Stream, together with its northern extension, North Atlantic Drift, is a powerful, warm, and swift Atlantic ocean current that originates in the Gulf of Mexico, exits through the Strait of Florida, and follows the eastern coastlines of the United States and Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The Gulf Stream influences the climate of the east coast of North America from Florida to Newfoundland, and the west coast of Europe. Its extension toward Europe, called the North Atlantic drift, makes Western Europe, and especially Northern European winters, considerably warmer than they otherwise would be. For example, the Gulf Stream is one of the reasons why certain parts of the west of Britain and Ireland are an average of several degrees warmer than most other parts of those countries. Also, in January, the temperature difference between coastal Norway and northern parts of continental Canada is about thirty degrees Celcius on average, even though they are the same latitude. In North America, the Gulf Stream is influential on the climate of the east coast of Florida, especially southeast Florida helping to keep temperatures warmer than in the rest of the southeastern United States in the winter. In summer the effect is opposite but small. The Gulf Stream makes the climate of offshore islands of Massachusetts, Martha\'s Vineyard and Nantucket, milder than that of Massachusetts Bay, which is isolated from its effects by Cape Cod.

The most common type is the red imported fire ant. Red imported fire ants live in colonies. First, they nest in the ground. They are usually found wherever there is grass. However, some fire ants create nests in the walls of buildings. As they build the colony, they create a mound of dirt over the nest. The mound can grow up to eighteen inches high and over two feet wide. When you get bitten by a fire ant, you will feel a sharp pain and a burning at the site. Each sting will turn into an itchy blister over the next day. The fire ants\' bite contains venom. This can cause the area to swell up quite a bit. You treat the bite the same way you treat a bee sting. Wash the area with soap and water. Rub the sting with a cotton ball soaked in vinegar and water. You can also hold an ice cube against it. Some people have an allergic reaction to fire ants. The symptoms are just like the ones from a bee sting. If you have any of these symptoms, see a doctor as soon as possible. The best way to avoid getting bitten is to avoid fire ants and their mounds. If you\'re near a mound, keep your shoes on. And don\'t ever poke at it or try to play with it.

Daguerre announced his splendid discovery; its astounding results, as well as its bearing on the art of design claimed his attention. In a letter on the subject, the Professor details the following interesting facts: "The process was a secret, and negotiations were then in progress, for the disclosure of it to the public between the French government and the distinguished discoverer. M. Daguerre had shown his results to the king, and to a few only of the distinguished savants, and by the advice of M. Arago, had determined to wait the action of the French Chambers, before showing them to any other persons. I was exceedingly desirous of seeing them, but knew not how to approach M. Daguerre who was a stranger to me. On mentioning my desire to Robert Walsh, Esq., our worthy Consul, he said to me, \'State that you are an American, the inventor of the Telegraph, request to see them, and invite him in turn to see the Telegraph, and I know enough of the urbanity and liberal feelings of the French, to insure you an invitation.\' I was successful in my application, and with a young friend, since deceased, the promising son of Edward Delevan, Esq., I passed a most delightful hour with M. Daguerre, and his enchanting pictures. My letter containing an account of this visit, and these pictures, was the first announcement in this country of this splendid discovery. \'I may here add the singular sequel to this visit. On the succeeding day M. Daguerre paid me a visit to see the Telegraph and witness its operations. He seemed much gratified and remained with me perhaps two hours; two melancholy hours to him, as they afterwards proved; or while he was with me, his buildings, including his diorama, his studio, his laboratory, with all the beautiful pictures I had seen the day before, were consumed by fire. Fortunately for mankind, matter only was consumed, the soul and mind of the genius, and the process were still in existence.\' On his return home, Professor Morse waited with impatience for the revelation of M. Daguerre\'s process, and no sooner was it published than he obtained a copy of the work containing it, and at once commenced taking Daguerreotype pictures. At first his goal was solely to furnish his studio with studies from nature; however, his experiments led him to believe that creating portraits by the process would be practical, and he was undoubtedly the first whose attempts were met with success.

(91, 91, 1, 'How do you qualify to become an astronaut? The first step is to fill out an application, which you send to the Johnson Space Center, JSC in short, in Houston, Texas. There it will be reviewed and ranked according to height considerations, experience, and expertise, i.e. geologists, physicists, chemists, biologists etc. The competition is fierce. About four thousand individuals apply every two years, and the slots are limited. And if the applicant is looking for a pilot or commander position, then they must also be prepared to log in at least thousand hours of flight time in command of a jet aircraft prior to consideration. Most of the current and former pilot or commander positions have been filled historically by men who have served or are currently active in the United States Armed Forces. There are only a few exceptions. During training all crew members will train aboard a T Thirty Eight jet. The controls are identical to that of the Space Shuttle and, therefore, the jet can be used as a flight simulator either on the ground or in actual flight. Once the initial ranking is complete, the applications go through a second, more stringent, round to narrow down the field. From the initial four thousand applicants, only about one hundred and eighteen are asked to come to the JSC and undergo a week of interviews, medical examinations, and basic orientation. Ochoa noted that the Astronaut Selection Board, ASB, generally looks for people who have done very well in a technical field. And very well does not mean just their grades. Candidates should make sure they have sterling recommendations, especially from undergraduate and graduate school professors who can attest to their problem solving abilities, communication skills, and their ability to work well as part of a team. The ASB interviews each person and assigns him or her a rating based on: experience and potential, motivation, ability to function as a member of a team, communication skills, and adaptability. Applicants who have impeccable school records and plenty of outside experience but who do not possess the required interpersonal skills for the position, may be rejected solely on that basis. Being an astronaut really means being part of a team. A significant number of applicants do not meet medical standards, and still others withdraw after gaining a complete understanding of the very demanding job. Based on the information collected during this investigation, ASB will choose its final candidates and pass that recommendation on to the NASA Administrator; he or she will make the final choices. Once selected, candidates begin a rigorous training program. As with any other career, being an astronaut has drawbacks. One commonly shared among astronauts is the intense workload and the lack of time for their families. And if an applicant has hopes for a large salary, say, comparable to those in the private sector, they should look elsewhere. But for those who dream of going into space, the pay is one of the lesser considerations. ', 'Misspelt and Common Words Exercise'),

Let\'s do some easy mathematics: 3 + 4 = 7, 1 + 9 = 10, 22 + 33 = 55, 15 - 5 = 10, 3 - 2 = 1. Would you like to do more? Lewis Carroll: " \'The time has come,\' the Walrus said, \'To talk of many things: Of shoes- and ships - and sealing wax - Of cabbages - and kings - And why the sea is boiling hot - And whether pigs have wings.\' " He enjoys true leisure who has time to improve his soul\'s estate. It is easier to fight for one\'s principles than to live up to them. "The most important product of an individual\'s effort is his own personality." Forgive, O Lord, my little jokes on Thee: And I\'ll forgive Thy great big one on me. "The one thing that doesn\'t abide by majority rule is an individual\'s conscience," he said. True kindness presupposes the faculty of imagining as one\'s own the suffering and joys of others. J. W. Von Goethe: "I\'ve studied now Philosophy - and Jurisprudence, Medicine -And even, alas! Theology - From end to end with labour keen; And here, poor fool, with all my lore I stand, no wiser than before." ', 'Special Keys + - = Exercise 2'),

The @ symbol is sometimes called the ape-tail, but really it is short hand for the word "at". Use [ ]--not brackets--when you insert a word or phrase into a quotation. The ampersand (&) is not correctly used in place of the word "and" in a sentence. Ellipsis ( ... ) or ( . . . ) is used to show that something has been omitted. Brackets can also indicate multiplication: 2(5) = 10 The company is called "Brown & Jones, Solicitors". In HTML coding, &amp; is used for &.

Chording is pressing keys simultaneously, such as [Ctrl] + [Alt] + [Del] keys needed to log on to some operating systems. Information in parentheses (like this, for example) are often examples. [Ctrl] key is the Control key, which was used in the days of teletype systems with the [C] key as a system IRQ. (09) 55 555 could be a Finnish telephone number. Square brackets are often used to indicate a key; such as [enter], for example. Some people claim that Pascal (1623-1662) discovered the triangle of binomial coefficients. Chemists use square brackets to indicate concentration, so [acid] means concentration of acid. Isaac Newton (1642-1727) is arguably the most important physicist and mathematician in modern history.
