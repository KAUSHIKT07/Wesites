(123, 1, 2, 'Aesop was one of the great Greek writers. He is best known for his fables, stories that have a moral. They teach us something about how we should live our lives. Aesop wrote thousands of these stories. Here are a few. The Wolf in Sheeps Clothing Once upon a time, a Wolf decided to disguise the way he looked. He thought it would help him get food more easily. He put on the skin of a sheep, then he went out with the flock into the pasture. Even the shepherd was fooled by his clever costume. In the evening, the shepherd put him in with the rest of the sheep. He closed the gate and made sure it was secure before he went to bed. In the middle of the night, he came back to the fold to get some meat for the next day. Instead of a sheep, though, he grabbed the Wolf, killing him instantly. Those who look to harm others will be harmed themselves. The Bat and the Weasel A Bat fell on the ground and was caught by a Weasel. It begged the Weasel to spare its life, but the Weasel refused. It told the Bat that birds, by nature, were its enemy. The Bat assured him that it was not a bird, it was a mouse. The Weasel thought a moment, then set it free. A while later, the Bat fell again to the ground, and it was caught by another Weasel. It begged this Weasel not to eat him, either. The Weasel, though, said it did not like mice at all and would eat it. The Bat told the Weasel that it was not a mouse, but a bat. The second Weasel had no good answer, so he let it go. The Bat knew it is always wise to turn events to your advantage. The Lion and the Mouse A sleeping Lion was woken up by a Mouse running over his face. He got up angrily and caught the scared little Mouse. He was about to kill the Mouse, but it said in its squeaky little voice, "If you would only spare my life, I would be sure to repay your kindness." The Lion laughed at such nonsense, but he let him go. A short time later, though, the Lion was caught by some hunters. They bound him by ropes to the ground. The Mouse recognized his roar, and he rushed over and gnawed the rope with his teeth, setting the Lion free. The Mouse said "You laughed at the idea of my ever being able to help you. Now you know that it is possible for even a small little Mouse to help a great big Lion." The Fox and the Crow A Crow stole a bit of meat, and she perched in a tree, holding it firmly in her beak. A Fox saw her there and knew he wanted the meat for himself. He came up with a plan. "How handsome is the Crow," he said. "Her shape is beautiful and her feathers bright. If only her voice were equal to her beauty, she would be called the Queen of Birds!" He lied when he said this, but the Crow was vain. She wanted to show the Fox that her voice really was as beautiful as he said. She opened her mouth wide and cawed loudly, dropping the meat to the ground. The Fox quickly picked it up and shook his head with scorn. "My good Crow," he said, your voice is fine, but you dont have the brains to use it well."', 'Aesop was one of '),

It is sufficient punishment for hitting a foul ball that he, as batsman, be deprived of making a base, without adding the unjust penalty of an out. This one sided condition of things, too, is increased when a double play is made on the catch of a foul ball, for not only is the batsman unfairly punished, but also the base runner who may have made the base by a clean hit. It is this latter unfair rule which the committee repealed in getting rid of the foul fly tip; and now a batsman who has earned his base by a safe hit and who runs to the next base on a foul fly tip ball caught by the catcher, can no longer be put out on the double play, as he is now allowed to return to the base he left on the hit, as in the case of a foul ball not caught. Another step in advance was made by the committee when they officially recognized a sacrifice hit as a factor in team work at the bat. Hitherto far too great a stress has been laid upon the alleged skill of the batsman in making extra hits -- two and three baggers and home runs -- at the cost of giving due credit to the batting which forwards base runners and sends in runs. The work of the slugging batsman who, nearly every time he goes to the bat when no one is on the bases, makes an extra hit, does not compare with that of the team worker who either by a single base hit or a sacrifice hit forwards a runner round the bases, or sends a run in. Here is where the batting averages prove to be complete failures so far as affording a criterion of a batsmans value in team work is concerned; which work, by the way, is neither more nor less than that of forwarding base runners or sending runs in by batting -- for one batsman may make four extra base hits in a game without forwarding a runner or sending in a run in a single instance, while another batsman may make but one safe hit and three sacrifice hits, and yet either forward as many runners or send in as many runs. Probably the best piece of work done by the committee was the amendment they made to the rules governing the umpire, wherein, in defining the powers of an umpire to impose a fine of not less than $5 nor more than $25 for abusive, threatening, or improper language to the umpire, an amendment was made as follows: "A repetition of the offence shall subject such player to a removal from the game, and the immediate substitution of another player then in uniform." Lastly, the rule admitting of an extra substitute being allowed to play in the game, at the option of the captain of either of the contesting teams, though an experiment, gives promise of being a desirable amendment. The classifying of the code of rules so as to facilitate the finding of any special rule during the hurry of a contest in progress, was also a desirable improvement. Take it altogether, the present committee did excellent work at their Fall meeting of 1888. Overrunning the bases', 'an opportunity to catch '),

HOW THE MIND WORKS My research on mind and language has been supported by the National Institutes of Health (grant HD 18381), the National Science Foundation hy are there so many robots in fiction, but none in real life? I would pay a lot for a robot that could put away the dishes or run simple errands. But I will not have the opportunity in this century, and probably not in the next one either. There are, of course, robots that weld or spray-paint on assembly lines and that roll through laboratory hallways; my question is about the machines that walk, talk, see, and think, often better than their human masters. Since 1920, when Karel Capek coined the word robot in his play R.U.R., dramatists have freely conjured them up: Speedy, Cutie, and Dave in Isaac Asimovs I, Robot, Robbie in Forbidden Planet, the flailing canister in Lost in Space, the daleks in Dr. Who, Rosie the Maid in Thejetsons, Nomad in Star Trek, Hymie in Get Smart, the vacant butlers and bickering haberdashers in Sleeper, R2D2 and C3PO in Star Wars, the Terminator in The Terminator, Lieutenant Commander Data in Star Trek: The Next Generation, and the wisecracking film critics in Mystery Science Theater 3000. This book is not about robots; it is about the human mind. I will try to explain what the mind is, where it came from, and how it lets us see, think, feel, interact, and pursue higher callings like art, religion, and philosophy. On the way I will try to throw light on distinctively human quirks. Why do memories fade? How does makeup change the look of a face? Where do ethnic stereotypes come from, and when are they irrational? Why do people lose their tempers? What makes children bratty? Why do fools fall in love? What makes us laugh? And why do people believe in ghosts and spirits? But the gap between robots in imagination and in reality is my starting point, for it shows the first step we must take in knowing Ourselves: appreciating the fantastically complex design behind feats of mental life we take for granted. The reason there are no humanlike robots is not that the very idea of a mechanical mind is misguided. It is that the engineering problems that we humans solve as we see and walk and plan and make it through the day are far more challenging than landing on the moon or sequencing the human genome. Nature, once again, has found ingenious solutions that human engineers cannot yet duplicate. When Hamlet says, "What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how express and admirable!" we should direct our awe not at Shakespeare or Mozart or Einstein or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar but at a four-year old carrying out a request to put a toy on a shelf. In a well-designed system, the components are black boxes that perform their functions as if by magic. That is no less true of the mind. The faculty with which we ponder the world has no ability to peer inside itself or our other faculties to see what makes them tick. That makes us the victims of an illusion: that our own psychology comes from some divine force or mysterious essence or almighty principle.

In 1879, I went to Fort Pierre and drove trains from Rapid City to Fort Pierre for Frank Witc then drove teams from Fort Pierce to Sturgis for Fred Evans. This teaming was done with oxen, as they were better fitted for the work than horses, owing to the rough nature of the country. In 1881, I went to Wyoming and returned in 1882 to Miles City and took up a ranch on the Yellow Stone, raising stock and cattle; also kept a way-side inn, where the weary traveler could be accommodated with food, drink, or trouble if he looked for it. Left the ranch in 1883, went to California, going through the States and territories, reached Ogden the latter part of 1883 and San Francisco in 1884. Left San Francisco in the summer of 1884 for Texas, stopping at Fort Yuma, Arizona, the hottest spot in the United States. Stopping at all points of interest until I reached El Paso in the fall. While in El Paso, I met Mr. Clinton Burk, a native of Texas, who I married in August 1885, as I thought I had traveled through life long enough alone, and thought it was about time to take a partner for the rest of my days. We remained in Texas leading a quiet home life until 1889. On October 28th, 1887, I became the mother of a girl baby, the very image of its father, at least that is what he said, but who has the temper of its mother. When we left Texas we went to Boulder, Colorado, where we kept a hotel until 1893, after which we traveled through Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, then back to Montana, then to Dakota, arriving in Deadwood October 9th, 1895, after an absence of seventeen years. My arrival in Deadwood after an absence of so many years created quite an excitement among my many friends of the past, to such an extent that a vast number of the citizens who had come to Deadwood during my absence who had heard so much of Calamity Jane and her many adventures in former years were anxious to see me. Among the many whom I met were several gentlemen from eastern cities who advised me to allow myself to be placed before the public in such a manner as to give the people of the eastern cities an opportunity of seeing the Woman Scout who was made so famous through her daring career in the West and Black Hill countries. An agent of Kohl & Middleton, the celebrated museum men, came to Deadwood through the solicitation of the gentleman who I had met there, and arrangements were made to place me before the public in this manner. My first engagement began at the Palace Museum, Minneapolis, January 20th, 1896, under Kohl and Middletons management. Hoping that this little history of my life may interest all readers, I remain as in the older days, Yours, Mrs. M. Burk Better Known as Calamity Jane Once upon a time there were four little rabbits. Their names were: Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail, and Peter. They lived with their Mother under the root of a very big fir tree. "Now, children," said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, "you may go into the fields or down the road. But dont go into Mr. McGregors garden. Your father had an accident there.

Dont break any laws. Cyberspace is an extension of the real world. Just because youre dealing with computers and not people (at least not directly), it doesnt mean the law no longer applies. If its illegal in the real world, its probably illegal in cyberspace. Be polite. Youve certainly heard the saying "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." Its true not only when youre talking to someone face-to-face, but also when youre talking to them on the Web. Being polite doesnt just include what you say. It also covers how you say it, and to whom. If you use humor or sarcasm in your writing, be sure the recipient is going to like your sense of humor. Otherwise, you might offend the person. And never send an e-mail when youre angry or upset! It will probably show in your message, and you may hurt someone elses feelings. Be careful of flames and flame wars. A "flame" refers to any insulting message. Nearly everyone receives a flame sooner or later. The question becomes what to do with them. The best move is to just ignore them. If, however, you feel the flame is worth a response, your reply may start a flame war, where the insults continue back and forth. In these situations, everybody loses. Be patient. Everybody was new to the Internet at one time or another! Be patient with those who are new. If someone shows poor Netiquette, dont get angry. Politely respond and tell them of their error. Usually, the other person will be thankful for the advice. You may even find that you have made a new friend. Sometimes youll bump into someone that you just dont see eye to eye with. In those cases, all you can do is agree to disagree. Be concise and accurate. E-mail wasnt intended for carrying on long talks. E-mail is about convenience. Keep your messages brief and to the point. If you write long messages that drift from one subject to the next, your readers attention will drift as well. Also, take the time to delete long header text when youre forwarding or replying to an e-mail. This shows the recipient that you know their time is valuable, too. And above all, proofread your message for spelling and grammar before you send it. In cyberspace, people only know you from what you type. If youre sloppy with the basics, how can anyone trust you when its really important? Always fill-in the subject line! When you start receiving dozens of e-mails a day, youll come to appreciate people who use subject lines. The subject line is the only label you have to identify each of the messages in your mailbox. Use something appropriate, such as the topic sentence or the main idea. Be sure to keep it brief, though, since most e-mail clients only show the first 20-30 characters of the subject line anyway. Be careful with formatting. Remember that not everyone uses the same software to read their e-mail. Just because you can center your text and make it green and boldface doesnt mean your recipient can too! Some e-mail clients make all messages left-justified plain text, no matter how they were sent.

So the little girl walked on with her tiny, naked feet. They were quite red and numb from cold. The girl had many matches. She sold them for money. She kept most of them in an old apron. She held a bundle of them in her hand so people could see. But nobody had bought any from her the whole day. No one had given her a single cent. And now she was hungry. She had no money for food. She couldnt stay warm. Her body shook as she walked along. The flakes of snow covered her long, fair hair. It fell in lovely curls around her neck. But she didnt feel pretty. Right now she felt alone. She passed many houses. Candles shone in all the windows. And the air smelled of roast goose. It was New Years Eve. People were celebrating. They were all happy, but she was not. She found a corner made by two houses. She sat down and tried to keep out of the wind. She drew her feet up close to her. But she could not keep them warm. Her whole body grew colder. But she couldnt go home. She had not sold any matches today. She had no money to bring to her family. Her father would be angry. And it was cold at home, too. In her room, the wind whistled. The roof had large cracks. They were stopped with straw and rags. But the cold came in just the same. Her little hands were almost numb with cold. She had a thought. A match might bring her some comfort. If she only dared take one out of the bundle. She could draw it against the wall. It would light. She could warm her fingers by it. She took one out. She lit it. How it blazed, how it burned! It was a warm, bright flame. It looked like a candle. She held her hands over it. It felt wonderful. It seemed to the little girl as if she were sitting before a large fire. She stretched out her feet to warm them, too. But the small flame went out. The fire was gone. She had only the remains of the burnt-out match in her hand. She rubbed another one against the wall. It burned as brightly as the first. The light fell on the wall. She thought she could see into the room beyond. On the table was spread a snow-white tablecloth. And there was a splendid china set. The roast goose was hot. It was stuffed with apples and dried plums. Her mouth watered with hunger. She reached out for the goose. Her fingers almost touched it. Then, the match went out. Nothing was left but the thick, cold, damp wall. She lit another match. Now she was sitting under the most beautiful Christmas tree. Thousands of lights were burning on the green branches. Pretty pictures hung on the walls. They looked as lovely as the ones she had seen in the shop windows. The little girl held out her hands towards them. Just then, the match went out.

(129, 7, 2, 'counts at least 35, and possibly as many as 60, writers who worked on the script. Somehow the system found a way to not list most of them, and for that we can be grateful. The Directors Guild of America permits a film to list only one director, even when its generally known that two or more worked on it. Except in very rare cases (a death in mid-production, and it had better be in the very middle of mid-production) there is only one directing credit. This is very good for a directors ego, certainly for the one who gets the credit, but also for the one who doesnt -- particularly if he or she had started production and then been removed by the producer at the insistence of the star or the studio. The public wont know that the removed one either screwed up or incurred the wrath of those more powerful. In either case, the removed director will live to direct another day. More rarely, a director will take the initiative and leave a production because of conflicts that cannot be resolved (usually attributed to "creative differences"), again usually with the studio or the star. All of this will most likely take place either before or during the first few days of shooting. But wait, theres more! You may at some point have noticed the name George Spelvin or Georgina Spelvin or G. Spelvin or the like among the acting credits on a film. Thats traditionally the alias used by actors who for one reason or another do not want to be credited with their own names. (The original Georgina Spelvin was the star of a famous porn film). There can be lots of reasons for using the alias, ranging from unhappiness with the way the production turned out to conflicts with the director or producer, or simply as an in-joke. In the same way, directors have sometimes used "Alan Smithee" as their alias when they didnt want to be credited under their real name. In 1997 screenwriter Joe Eszterhas (best known for writing "Basic Instinct") even had the bright/stupid idea of making a movie called "An Alan Smithee Film." Not only did it bomb at the box office, but the real director -- Arthur Hiller -- took his name off the credits, so it truly was an "Alan Smithee" film. Now to the below-the-line credits. When the movie fades to black, a new set of names begins to scroll up the screen. Sometimes the first credits we see will go to the production crew, the people who worked on the shooting, and sometimes they will be for the cast, often in order of prominence in the film, though sometimes in order of appearance or in alphabetical order. The production crew credits will be where all the "funny" titles start coming up, and heres what they do: The "gaffer" is the chief electrician. He (or sometimes she) works for the director of photography, setting up all the lights as they are needed for shooting, directing a crew of other electricians, preparing the basic lighting for the next scenes to be shot, ordering all lighting equipment and supplies, and so forth. And guess who his or her top assistant is? Yes, the "best boy." Sexist but accurate, since theyre almost always men. "Grips" are the crew members who carry and set up equipment around the set or location. On most productions, the head grip will be called the "key grip," and on very big productions, where two crews will be shooting at the same time, there will be more', 'counts at least 35, '),

Whats more interesting, though, are some of the stories told about him. Many of these are true. Others have become tall tales or legends. They give us more a sense of the man than simple facts can. The following are just a few: This was reported by A.B. Chandler, manager of postal telegraphs. He worked for the War Department during the Civil War. On New Years morning, 1864, President Lincoln entered the War Department building. He was always a bit jumpy. Now, though, he had become very tense. He was irritated by hearing a woman wailing over a child in her arms. Major Eckert asked the woman why she was crying. He brought back the painful but not surprising explanation. She was the wife of a soldier. She had come to Washington with her baby, expecting to have no difficulty in getting a pass to see her husband. She learned that this was not true. If she were the wife of an officer, she could easily get such a pass. Her husband, though, was a private. It would not be so simple. She had little money, and Washington was an expensive city. She didnt know how she was going to afford to wait until she could see her husband. "Come, Eckert," blurted out Lincoln, "lets send the woman down there!" He was told that the war office had strengthened the orders against letting women into camp. "Hmm!" replied Lincoln, glaring at the man. "Let us whip the devil around the stump since he will not step right over! Send the womans husband a leave of absence. He will report here to see his wife and baby!" The officer on duty wrote the order, and the couple were happily reunited. Another story goes as follows: Creditors treated the struggling Lincoln with the utmost patience. They often quoted the moral that patience is not pardon. Lincoln was given the chance to show his own patience when his turn came. Before he became president, Lincoln was a lawyer. One of his clients was long overdue in paying his bill. He ran into the man by chance on the steps of the Springfield court house. He greeted him politely and commented about the mans accident. Cogdale had lost a hand in a gunpowder accident. He began to apologize for his overdue bill, showing that he was crippled. Lincoln plainly expressed his sympathy and sorrow. "I have been thinking about that bill of yours," he said. He took the paper out of his wallet and forced it upon him. "I wont think of it any more." Cogdale took the bill. He told Lincoln that he did not know when he could pay it. But Lincoln hurried away, saying, "If you had the money, I would not take it out of your only hand!" A third story is told that: On September 17, 1862, the Confederate march into Maryland ended with the decisive defeat at Antietam. When the South pulled back, Lincoln called the Cabinet to a special meeting. He told the men that the time had come at last for his announcement of freedom to the slaves everywhere in the United States. After much doubt, he believed public opinion would now support this action. "Besides, I promised my God I would do it. I made a solemn vow before God that, if General Lee was driven back from', 'deal about him both '),

A white cat was staring at some goldfish in the pond. She sat very, very still. But now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her. He had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny. He didnt think shed be very friendly. He went back the way he came, towards the toolshed. Suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe -- scr-r-ritch, scr-r-ratch. Peter dove under the bushes, shaking with fear. He waited and waited, but nothing happened. He poked his nose out, then his front paws, then his back paws. He climbed on top of a wheelbarrow and peeped over. The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was turned towards Peter and beyond him was the gate! Oh, how wonderful! Peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow. He started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some berry bushes. Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care. He slipped underneath the gate and out into the wood outside the garden. Safe at last! Peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir tree. He was so tired that he flopped down on the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit hole and shut his eyes. His mother was busy cooking. She wondered what he had done with his clothes. She didnt know that Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes as a scarecrow to frighten the birds. Peter did not feel very well during the rest of the evening. His mother put him to bed, made him a hot cut of tea, and gave him a spoonful of bad-tasting medicine. "Drink it up, Peter." Then she kissed him goodnight. But Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail felt just fine. They had bread, and milk, and blackberries for supper. Benjamin Franklin was not only one of the Founding Fathers of Colonial America, but he was one of the premier thinkers and statesmen of that time. It is interesting, therefore, to take a look at some of his thoughts and opinions -- in his own words: Good works and their reward. -- For my own part, when I am employed in serving others, I do not look upon myself as conferring favors, but as paying debts. In my travels, and since my settlement, I have received much kindness from men, to whom I shall never have any opportunity of making the least direct return. And numberless mercies from God, who is infinitely above being benefitted by our services. Those kindnesses from men, I can therefore only return on their fellow men; and I can only show my gratitude for these mercies from God, by a readiness to help his other children and my brethren. For I do not think that thanks and compliments, though repeated weekly, can discharge our real obligations to each other, and much less those to our Creator. You will see in this my notion of good works, that I am far from expecting (as you suppose) that I shall ever merit Heaven by them. By Heaven we understand a state of happiness, infinite in degree, and eternal in duration: I can do nothing to', 'he became more and '),
(132, 10, 2, 'I would crown the result by the declaration of freedom to the slave!" People said that his signature appeared hesitant and uneven. However, Lincoln assured them that was not "because of any uncertainty or hesitation on my part." He told the painter of the "Signing the Emancipation Act," Mr. Carpenter, "I believe that I am about as glad over the success of this work as you are!" The original document was destroyed in the great fire at Chicago, where it was on display. The pen and the table it was written on are in the Lincoln Museum. The ink-stand was a wooden one, in private hands. It was bought at public sale when Lincoln relics were not at the current high price. And then there is the one: The passing of time brings about strange events. General McClellan was chosen to visit the seat of the Crimean War. When he returned home, he saw no opportunities in his profession. He had to look for another job. He became director of the Illinois Central Railroad Company. In December, 1855, a bill was laid on his desk. It was the demand of Abraham Lincoln, of the law firm of Lincoln & Herndon, Springfield, Illinois. The firm had represented the company the past October. It defended the company against a suit brought by McLean County. Lincoln had won the case. The fee was $1,000. One-fourth of that had been paid for the retainer. To prevent any objection about the rest, Lincoln had six members of the bar add their names to testify the charge was usual and just. Even so, McClellan saw it and refused to pay, saying that, "This is as much as a first-class lawyer would charge!" Even with his success, others though of Lincoln as still "the one-horse lawyer of a one-horse town." But perhaps the story that tells us most about "Honest Abe" goes: If you look at the history of the Presidents, you will see that Lincolns origin is described as "English." But the English love of fair play is joined with the art of not knowing when a man is beaten. If Lincoln is English, he differs from his ancestors on this point. During the Black Hawk War, the soldiers in camp entertained themselves by sports contests. The captain of the Sangamon company topped all his men in such events. This led the men to challenge the entire army. They offered Lincoln as a contestant against the whole field. A man in another regiment, named Thompson, showed up to fight Lincoln. Their preliminary match made Lincoln believe that this time he had bitten off more than he could chew. He suggested as much to his backers, who were betting not only all their money, but all their equipment, too, on Lincolns win. They didnt believe him. But the first bout ended disastrously for Illinois. Lincoln was clearly "downed." The next, or settling bout, ended the same way. Lincolns supporters, though, would not "see," and refused to pay up their bets. The whole company was about to fight over the decision, when Captain Lincoln spoke up: "Boys, Thompson threw me fair and clean the first time. And he did the same the next time, but not so clearly." "In peace or in war," it was always the same "Honest Abe." Do you ever send or receive e-mails? Are you on the Internet a lot? Do you go to chat rooms?

When able to ride, I started for Fort Laramie where I met William Hickock, better known as Wild Bill, and we started for Deadwood, where we arrived about June. During the month of June I acted as a pony express rider, carrying the U.S. mail between Deadwood and Custer, a distance of fifty miles, over one of the roughest trails in the Black Hills country. Many of the riders before me had been held up and robbed of their packages, mail, and money that they carried, but that was the only means of getting mail and money between these points. It was considered the most dangerous route in the Hills, but as my reputation as a rider and quick shot was well known, I was molested very little, for the toll gatherers looked on me as being a good fellow, and they knew that I never missed my mark. I made the round trip every two days which was considered pretty good riding in that country. Remained around Deadwood all that summer visiting all the camps within an area of one hundred miles. My friend, Wild Bill, remained in Deadwood during the summer with the exception of occasional visits to the camps. On the 2nd of August, while sitting at a gambling table in the Bell Union saloon, in Deadwood, he was shot in the back of the head by the notorious Jack McCall, a desperado. I was in Deadwood at the time and on hearing of the killing made my way at once to the scene of the shooting and found that my friend had been killed by McCall. I at once started to look for the assassin and found him at Shurdys Butcher Shop and grabbed a meat cleaver and made him throw up his hands, through the excitement on hearing of Bills death, having left my weapons on the post of my bed. He was then taken to a log cabin and locked up, well-secured as every one thought, but he got away and was afterwards caught at Fagans ranch on Horse Creek, on the old Cheyenne road, and was then taken to Yankton, Dakota, where he was tried, sentenced, and hung. I remained around Deadwood locating claims, going from camp to camp until the spring of 1877, where, one morning, I saddled my horse and rode towards Crook City. I had gone about twelve miles from Deadwood, at the mouth of Whitewood Creek, when I met the overland mail running from Cheyenne to Deadwood. The horses on a run, about two hundred yards from the station; upon looking closely I saw they were pursued by Indians. The horses ran to the barn as was their custom. As the horses stopped, I rode alongside of the coach and found the driver John Slaughter, lying face downwards in the boot of the stage, he having been shot by the Indians. When the stage got to the station the Indians hid in the bushes. I immediately removed all baggage from the coach except the mail. I then took the drivers seat and with all haste drove to Deadwood, carrying the six passengers and the dead driver. I left Deadwood in the fall of 1877, and went to Bear Butte Creek with the 7th Cavalry. During the fall and winter we built Fort Meade and the town of Sturgis. In 1878, I left the command and went to Rapid', 'make and being wet '),

One of its greatest misfortunes arises from this circumstance; for the subjects on which it is conversant are so difficult, and require such un-remitted devotion of time, that few who have not spent years in their study can judge of the relative knowledge of those who pursue them. It follows, therefore, that the public, and even that men of sound sense and discernment, can scarcely find means to distinguish between the possessors of knowledge, in the present day, merely elementary, and those whose acquirements are of the highest order. This remark applies with peculiar force to all the more difficult applications of mathematics; and the fact is calculated to check the energies of those who only look to reputation in England. Baseball has been the national pastime in the United States since the middle of the 1800s. Each period has had a unique flavor, and it is sometimes useful to read about a period from the perspective of the time in which it took place. The following comes from "Spaldings Baseball Guide and Official League Book for 1889," written in that same year; the language has not been edited to reflect modern expressions or word usage. The Joint Rules Committee and their work The work accomplished by the Joint Rules Committee of the National League and the American Association at their meeting in New York in November, 1888, ranks with the best on record in the revision of the playing rules of the game, and the successful results achieved in improving the code were largely due to the marked efficiency evinced by the chairman of the Committee, Mr. Chas. H. Byrne, the president of the Brooklyn Club, who was indefatigable in doing the large amount of revisory work which was thrown upon the committee. In the face of a very noisy and sensational demand for radical changes in the rules governing the game, the committee, as a whole, manifested a wise conservatism in several respects, which cannot help but be of material assistance in advancing the welfare of the game at large. In the first place, by reducing the powers of the attack nearer to an equality with those of the defense -- which result was accomplished when they reduced the number of called balls from five to four -- they not only adopted a rule which will moderate the dangerous speed in delivering the ball to the bat, but they thereby afforded the batsman an additional chance for more effective work at the bat. This latter point, too, has been aided by reducing the number of outs the batsman has hitherto been unfairly subjected to. The rule which puts batsmen out on catches of foul balls, which, since the game originated, has been an unfair rule of play, has seen its best day; and this year the entering wedge to its ultimate disappearance has been driven in, with the practical result of the repeal of the foul tip catch. This improvement, too, is in the line of aiding the batting side, as it gets rid of one of the numerous ways of putting the batsman out. The argument brought to bear in favor of the elimination of outs from foul balls from the code was in the main as follows: When the batsman hits a fair ball, while at the same time that he gives the fielders a chance to put him out, he himself is also given an equal chance of making a base or of scoring a run; but when he hits a foul ball, while he affords the', 'many of the advantages '),

Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail were good little bunnies. They went down the lane to find some blackberries. But Peter was very naughty. He ran right away to Mr. McGregors garden and squeezed under the gate! First he ate some lettuce and some carrots. Then he nibbled on some radishes. And then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley. But when he came to the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor! Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, "Stop thief!" Peter was very scared. He rushed all over the garden. He had forgotten the way back to the gate. He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe near the potatoes. Without shoes, he dropped to all four legs so he could run faster. He might have gotten completely away if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry fence. He was wearing a blue jacket with brass buttons, and the buttons got caught in the net. Peter gave himself up for lost, and he shed big tears. But some friendly sparrows heard him crying. They flew down to him and begged him to keep trying to escape. "You can do it, Peter," they said. Mr. McGregor had a big butterfly net in his hands. He came up behind Peter and tried to scoop him up. But Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him. He rushed into the toolshed and saw a large watering can. It looked big and beautiful and a great place in which to hide. He jumped inside. It wasnt until he had that he realized it had water in it. Mr. McGregor was quite sure Peter was somewhere in the shed. Perhaps he was hidden underneath a flower pot. He turned each one over carefully, looking under them one by one, but Peter wasnt there. It was then that Peter sneezed, "Ahchoo!" Mr. McGregor was after him in no time. The net was no good in such a small space, so he tried to step on Peter. Peter was fast, though, and he jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. The window was too small for Mr. McGregor to fit through. And he was tired of running after Peter. He went back to his work. Outside, Peter sat down to rest. He was out of breath and trembling with fright. And he still didnt have any idea which way to go. Also, he was very damp from sitting in that can. His fur was matted, and he was cold. He sat for a while, then he began to wander about, going hop-hop-hop. He didnt go very fast, and he looked all around to see where he was. He found a door in a wall, but it was locked. There was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath. An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the woods. Peter asked her the way to the gate. But she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer. She only shook her head at him. Peter began to cry again. Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden.', 'mischief I am going '),

Mother died at Black Foot, Montana, 1866, where we buried her. I left Montana in Spring of 1866, for Utah, arriving at Salt Lake City during the summer. Remained in Utah until 1867, where my father died, then went to Fort Bridger, Wyoming Territory, where we arrived May 1, 1868; then went to Piedmont, Wyoming, with U.P. Railway. Joined General Custer as a scout at Fort Russell, Wyoming, in 1870, and started for Arizona for the Indian Campaign. Up to this time I had always worn the costume of my sex. When I joined Custer, I donned the uniform of a soldier. It was a bit awkward at first, but I soon got to be perfectly at home in mens clothes. Was in Arizona up to the winter of 1871 and during that time I had a great many adventures with the Indians, for as a scout I had a great many dangerous missions to perform and while I was in many close places, always succeeded in getting away safely for by this time I was considered the most reckless and daring rider and one of the best shots in the western country. After that campaign I returned to Fort Sanders, Wyoming, remained there until spring of 1872, when we were ordered out to the Muscle Shell or Nursey Pursey Indian outbreak. In that war Generals Custer, Miles, Terry and Crook were all engaged. This campaign lasted until fall of 1873. It was during this campaign that I was christened Calamity Jane. It was on Goose Creek, Wyoming, where the town of Sheridan is now located. Captain Egan was in command of the Post. We were ordered out to quell an uprising of the Indians and were out for several days, had numerous skirmishes during which six of the soldiers were killed and several severely wounded. When on returning to the Post we were ambushed about a mile and a half from our destination. When fired upon, Captain Egan was shot. I was riding in advance and, on hearing the firing, turned in my saddle and saw the Captain reeling in his saddle as though about to fall. I turned my horse and galloped back with all haste to his side and got there in time to catch him as he was falling. I lifted him onto my horse in front of me and succeeded in getting him safely to the Fort. Captain Egan on recovering, laughingly said: "I name you Calamity Jane, the heroine of the plains." I have borne that name up to the present time. We were afterwards ordered to Fort Custer, where Custer City now stands, where we arrived in the spring of 1874; remained around Fort Custer all summer and were ordered to Fort Russell in fall of 1874, where we remained until spring of 1875; was then ordered to the Black Hills to protect miners, as that country was controlled by the Sioux Indians and the government had to send the soldiers to protect the lives of the miners and settlers in that section. Remained there until fall of 1875 and wintered at Fort Laramie. In spring of 1876, we were ordered north with General Crook to join Generals Miles, Terry, and Custer at Big Horn river.

(To Mary Stevenson, [1759]) Exercise. -- In considering the different kinds of exercise, I have thought, that the quantum of each is to be judged of, not by time or by distance, but by the degree of warmth it produces in the body. Thus, when I observe, if I am cold when I get into a carriage in a morning, I may ride all day without being warmed by it; that, if on horseback my feet are cold, I may ride some hours before they become warm; but, if I am ever so cold on foot, I cannot walk an hour briskly, without glowing from head to foot by the quickened circulation; I have been ready to say, (using round numbers without regard to exactness, but merely to mark a great difference), that there is more exercise in one miles riding on horseback, than in five in a coach; and more in one miles walking on foot, than in five on horseback; to which I may add, that there is more in walking one mile up and down stairs, than in five on a level floor. The two latter exercises may be had within doors, when the weather discourages going abroad; and the last may be had when one is pinched for time, as containing a great quantity of exercise in a handful of minutes. The dumb bell is another exercise of the latter compendious kind. By the use of it I have in forty swings quickened my pulse from sixty to one hundred beats in a minute, counted by a second watch; and I suppose the warmth generally increases with quickness of pulse. (To William Franklin, August 19, 1772) Moral algebra. -- When difficult cases occur, they are difficult, chiefly because while we have them under consideration, all the reasons pro and con are not present to the mind at the same time; but sometimes one set present themselves, and at other times another, the first being out of sight. Hence the various purposes or inclinations that alternately prevail, and the uncertainty that perplexes us. To get over this, my way is, to divide half a sheet of paper by a line into two columns; writing over the one Pro, and over the other Con. Then during three or four days consideration, I put down under the different heads short hints of the different motives, that at different times occur to me, for or against the measure. When I have thus got them all together in one view, I endeavor to estimate their respective weights; and where I find two, one on each side, that seem equal, I strike them both out. If I find a reason pro equal to some two reasons con, I strike out the three. If I judge some two reasons con, equal to some three reasons pro, I strike out the five; and thus proceeding I find at length where the balance lies; and if after a day or two of farther consideration, nothing new that is of importance occurs on either side, I come to a determination accordingly. And, though the weight of reasons cannot be taken with the precision of algebraic quantities, yet, when each is thus considered, separately and comparatively, and the whole lies before me, I think I can judge better, and am less liable to make a rash step; and in fact I have found great advantage from this kind of equation, in what may be called moral or prudential algebra.

(138, 16, 2, 'Priestley September 19 1772 Scientific progress. -- The rapid progress true science now makes, occasions my regretting sometimes that I was born so soon. It is impossible to imagine the height to which may be carried, in a thousand years, the power of man over matter. We may perhaps learn to deprive large masses of their gravity, and give them absolute levity, for the sake of easy transport. Agriculture may diminish its labor and double its produce; all diseases may by sure means be prevented or cured, not excepting even that of old age, and our lives lengthened at pleasure even beyond the antediluvian standard. O that moral science were in as fair a way of improvement, that men would cease to be wolves to one another, and that human beings would at length learn what they now improperly call humanity! (To Joseph Priestley, February 8, 1780) If youre like most kids, youve probably broken a bone. Or maybe you know someone else who has. That means youve seen a cast. Do you know how a cast works? What its made of? Whether its OK to draw on one? Keep typing to find out more. Think of a cast as a big bandage that has two layers. Inside there is a soft cotton layer. It rests next to the skin. This makes the cast more comfortable. It also protects the skin. Outside there is a hard outer layer. This layer prevents the broken bone from moving. Sometimes you can choose how your cast looks. You can pick cool colors or patterns. Casts come in two types. The first type is made of plaster of Paris. You may have used this material for arts and crafts. Plaster of Paris is a heavy white powder. When its mixed with water, it forms a thick paste that gets hard fast. The second type is made of fiberglass. This is a plastic material. It can be shaped. Fiberglass casts come in lots of colors. These casts are lighter and stronger than plaster casts. That makes them easier to wear. It also makes them last longer. Your doctor will make sure that all the pieces of your broken bone are in their proper places. Then hell put on the cast to prevent the pieces from moving while they heal. This way theyll grow back together into one bone. It also prevents injury to the area around the bone. Most kids with broken bones say it actually feels much better once the cast is on. How long do you have to wear a cast? Sometimes its only for a few weeks. Sometimes its much longer. It depends on the type of injury you have. It also depends on how badly the bone was broken. Your doctor may put on the cast himself. Usually, though, another person who is specially trained to put on casts does it. First, he will measure the exact amount of soft cotton youll need. Second, he will wrap several layers around the broken area. Third, he will dip the plaster or fiberglass layer in water. This softens it so he can shape it. Last, hell wrap it snugly around the cotton. Before the outer layer dries, the cast may feel quite heavy. In a short time youll get used to wearing it. The cast may be on your arm. If so, you may be given a sling. A sling is a wide piece of cloth with straps. The straps go around your neck. They are attached to the cloth that goes around your arm. This will help you support and carry the', 'Priestley September 19 1772 '),
(139, 17, 2, 'such rewards He that for giving a draught of water to a thirsty person, should expect to be paid with a good plantation, would be modest in his demands, compared with those who think they deserve Heaven for the little good they do on Earth. Even the mixed imperfect pleasures we enjoy in this world are rather from Gods goodness than our merit; how much more such happiness of Heaven. For my own part I have not the vanity to think I deserve it, the folly to expect it, nor the ambition to desire it. (To Joseph Huey, June 6, 1753) Inventors and inventions. -- There are everywhere a number of people, who, being totally destitute of any inventive faculty themselves, do not readily conceive that others may possess it; they think of inventions as of miracles; there might be such formerly, but they are ceased. With these, every one who offers a new invention is deemed a pretender; he had it from some other country, or from some book; a man of their own acquaintance, one who has no more sense than themselves, could not possibly, in their opinion, have been the inventor of any thing. They are confirmed, too, in these sentiments, by frequent instances of pretensions to intervention, which vanity is daily producing. That vanity, too, though an incitement to invention, is, at the same time, the pest of inventors. Jealousy and envy deny the merit or the novelty of your invention; but vanity, when the novelty and merit are established, claims it for its own. The smaller your invention is, the more mortification you receive in having the credit of it disputed with you by a rival, whom the jealousy and envy of others are ready to support against you, at least so far as to make the point doubtful. It is not in itself of importance enough for a dispute; no one would think your proofs and reasons worth their attention; and yet, if you do not dispute the point, and demonstrate your right, you not only lose the credit of being in that instance ingenious, but you suffer the disgrace of not being ingenuous; not only of being a plagiary, but of being plagiary for trifles. Had the invention been greater, it would have disgraced you less; for men have not so contemptible an idea of him that robs for gold on the highway, as of him that can pick pockets for half-pence and farthings. Thus, through envy, jealousy, and the vanity of competitors for fame, the origin of many of the most extraordinary inventions, though produced within but a few centuries past, is involved in doubt and uncertainty. We scarce know to whom we are indebted for the compass, and spectacles, nor have even paper and printing, that record every thing else, been able to preserve with certainty the name and reputation of their inventors. One would not, therefore, of all faculties or qualities of the mind, wish, for a friend or a child, that he should have that of invention. (To John Lining, March 18, 1755) Error. -- There are few, though convinced, that know how to give up, even an error, they have been once engaged in maintaining; there is therefore the more merit in dropping a contest where one thinks ones self right; tis at least respectful to those we converse with. And indeed all our knowledge is so imperfect, and we are from a thousand causes so perpetually subject to mistake and error, that positiveness can scarce ever become even the most knowing; and modesty in advancing any opinion,', 'such rewards He that '),
(140, 18, 2, 'The cast may be on your leg. If so, you might get crutches to help you walk. Crutches let you keep the weight off the injured leg. Too much weight can prevent the bone from healing properly. Sometimes you get a special shoe to wear over the cast. The shoe lets you walk without putting too much weight on the cast. It looks clunky, but its better than being in pain! So now that you have a cast, what do you do? Here are some tips. First, if you have a plaster cast, you dont want to get it wet. Water will make the cast loose or even come off. Then it will not be able to keep the bones from moving. Also, the cotton padding beneath is hard to dry. If it gets wet, your skin may develop a rash or infection. That means if you take a bath, you have to cover the cast with a plastic bag. You can also buy a waterproof sleeve. Depending on where your cast is, you may have to take a sponge bath. You use a wet sponge or cloth to clean the rest of your body. You can wash your hair in the sink or go to the beauty parlor. That way you dont risk getting the cast wet. Luckily, some casts are also waterproof. This means you can get them wet without ruining the cast. Most of these are made of fiberglass. Also, the padding is not made of cotton. It is made of another waterproof material. With this type of cast you can take a shower or a bath without having to use a plastic bag or sleeve. You might even be able to swim! Be sure to check with your doctor first, though. Second, never stick anything inside your cast. You could injure the cast or the skin underneath. But the skin under the cast often itches. What should you do? Heres a neat trick -- use a blow-dryer set on "cool." Blow air inside the cast. It really works, and it wont hurt. Third, watch for cracks. Now, your cast may have cuts or cracks in it when its put on. Doctors sometimes make tiny cuts in the side. This allows room for possible swelling. Many times your body will swell near the broken bone. This is the bodys way of healing itself. The liquid under your skin protects the broken bone from further injury. But, your cast may also develop cracks on its own. This happens if it has been hit or crushed. Or it may have a weak spot. Your skin may swell underneath, too. If the doctor did not make a cut on the outside, the swelling may crack it. If you see a new crack, tell someone right away. You may have to see your doctor. Fourth, watch your skin color around the cast. You may see your fingers or toes turning purple or blue. That means the cast is too tight. You arent getting enough blood to those areas. Be sure to tell a parent right away. Your doctor will need to loosen the cast so you dont hurt the area more. Last, its perfectly okay for your friends and family to sign your cast. Permanent markers usually work best. Washable ones can smear. Its also fine to draw pictures on it. You can even decorate it with stickers. Be creative! This might make having a cast a little bit more fun. Doctors use a special saw to remove a cast. It has a dull, round blade that vibrates up and down.', 'The cast may be '),
(141, 19, 2, 'Two Dogs A Man had two dogs. One was a Hound, trained to assist him in his sports, and the other was a House Dog, taught to watch the house. When he came home after a good days hunting, he always gave the House Dog a large share of his catch. The Hound felt very hurt at this. He scolded his companion, saying, "My work is very hard, but it is harder to watch you. You do not help me with the chase, but you share in my reward. It is not fair." The House Dog replied, "Do not blame me, my friend. If you are angry, find fault with the master. He is the one who has taught me not to work but to depend on the work of others for my food. After all, you dont blame a child for the faults of its parents." The Kingdom of the Lion The Lion was the king of all the animals in the field and the forest. He was not violent or cruel, but he was as just and gentle as a king should be. During his reign, he called for a gathering of all the animals to draw up conditions for an alliance. In this alliance, the Wolf and the Lamb, the Tiger and the Deer, the Dog and the Hare, would live together in perfect peace. The Hare said, "Oh, how I have longed to see this day. Now the weak shall take their place by the side of the strong without fear." Everyone agreed, but after the Hare said this, he ran for his life. After all, you cannot believe everything you hear. The Wolf and the Crane A Wolf had a bone stuck in his throat. He hired a Crane, for a large sum, to put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone. When the Crane had taken out the bone, he demanded the promised payment. The Wolf, grinning and grinding his teeth, said, "Why, you have already received your reward -- you were allowed to draw out your head in safety from the mouth and jaws of a wolf." In serving the wicked, expect no reward. Be thankful if you escape injury for your pains. The Traveler and His Dog A Man about to set out on a journey saw his Dog stand at the door stretching himself. He asked him sharply, "Why do you stand there? Everything is ready but you, and I will be late. Come with me this instant!" The Dog, wagging his tail, replied, "O, master! I am quite ready. In fact, it is you for whom I am waiting." The late person often blames a delay on his more active friend. The Dog and the Shadow A Dog crossed a bridge over a stream with a piece of meat in his mouth. He saw his own shadow in the water and thought it was another dog. It looked like the dog had a piece of meat in its mouth double his own in size. He wanted the bigger piece! He had to have it! To get it, he let go of the piece in his own mouth and attacked the other dog, and as a result, he lost both pieces. He lost what was in the water because it was only a shadow, and he also lost his own because the stream swept it away.

On the day of the race, the two started together. The Tortoise never for a moment stopped. She went on with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. The Hare thought he had plenty of time, so he lay down along the way and fell fast asleep. When he woke up, he moved as fast as he could to the end of the course, but he was too late. The Tortoise had already reached the goal, and the race was done. Slow but steady wins the race. The Farmer and the Stork The Farmer placed nets on his newly planted fields. In them he caught a number of Cranes, which came to pick up his seed. One day he trapped a Stork that had broken his leg in the net. The Stork begged the Farmer to spare his life. "Please, save me," he said, "and let me go free. I have a broken leg, and besides, I am no Crane, I am a Stork. I am a bird of excellent character. Look too, at my feathers. They dont look at all like those of a Crane." The Farmer laughed aloud and said, "It may be as you say, but I only know this. I caught you along with a bunch of robbers. You are just as guilty as they are, and you must die like them." Birds of a feather flock together. The word "astronaut" derives from the Greek words meaning "star" and "sailor." These men and women -- Alan Shepherd, John Glenn, Jr., Sally Ride, to name a few -- conjure up images of bravery and adventure. They are modern heroes, helping humanity reach for the stars. When the space program began in 1959, there were only seven such people in the entire country. They all were then -- or had been in the past -- in the armed forces. Most of them were test pilots, used to the dangers that came from "pushing the envelope." That was only 36 years ago, and since then much has changed. Today the Americans who make up the shuttle crews are comprised of every race, creed, color, and gender. As of May 2, 1993, 180 men and 21 women astronauts were Caucasian, six men and one woman were African-American, three men and one woman were Hispanic, and two men were of Asian descent. NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, chooses its astronauts from an increasingly diverse pool of applicants that "looks like America." Thousands of applications come in from all over the world; from these, approximately 100 men and women are chosen for an intensive astronaut candidate training program every two years. "I cannot imagine a better career. Ive done more than I could ever have imagined. Im thankful that Ive been at the right place at the right time," says astronaut Kenneth S. Reightler. The training is demanding, but the study time involved is no longer than that of any other professional career requiring graduate/post-graduate study. If becoming an astronaut is a dream, held long and steadfast, then this labor will be one of love. The preparation for becoming an astronaut actually begins in elementary school.

Use care when attaching files. Attachments are an easy way to share programs, graphics, sounds, or any other kind of file you find on your computer. If you intend to send someone a large file (say, greater than 20K) you should contact them and ask their permission first. There are three reasons for this. First, you dont even know if they have e-mail software that can handle attached files. Second, large files (were talking megabytes here) can completely fill someones e-mail box. Then they cant receive any more e-mail. Third, some e-mail programs limit the size of file attachments. Your e-mail message may not get sent if the file is too large, or it may bounce back to you. Graphics and sound files tend to be quite large, so send these with care. Think about distribution lists. You may want to send an e-mail to several people at once. The best way to do this is to use a list. Start a blank text file. Start listing all the e-mail addresses you want included in the list, separated by a comma and a blank space. Cut and paste the distribution list into the "To," the "CC," or the "BCC" field in your e-mail client. Be sure to use your own e-mail address in the "To" field. That way you will receive an e-mail to verify that it was sent! The advantage to the BCC field is that everyone on your list will receive a copy of your message without the entire list appearing in the header. Distribution lists are not intended for spamming purposes. Its often the practice to include instructions on how to be removed from a distribution list for those who dont wish to receive future mailings. Do not spam! Spam is the e-mail equivalent of junk mail, and spamming is the practice of sending out unsolicited bulk e-mail. Some e-mail systems let you filter out unwanted mail, but theyre not perfect. And nothing gets people angrier than seeing their inbox fill up with junk every day. Do your part to help by not spamming others. And report any spam you get to your Internet Service Provider -- ISP.

During the transfer, a Thinking Machines 145 chamberpot containing her soul falls out the window and conks a passerby, played by Steve Martin, on the head. Tomlins dybbuk comes to rest in the right half of his body while he retains control of the left half. He lurches in a zigzag as first his left half strides in one direction and then his right half, pinkie extended, minces in the other. So, consciousness in the sense of access is coming to be understood. What about consciousness in the sense of sentience? Sentience and access may be two sides of a single coin. Our subjective experience is also the grist for our reasoning, speech, and action. We do not just experience a toothache; we complain about it and head to the dentist. Ned Block has tried to clarify the distinction between access and sentience by thinking up scenarios in which access could occur without sentience and vice versa. An example of access without sentience might be found in the strange syndrome called blindsight. When a person has a large blind spot because of damage to his visual cortex, he will adamantly deny that he can see a thing there, but when forced to guess where an object is, he performs well above chance. One interpretation is that the blindsighter has access to the objects but is not sentient of them. Whether or not this is correct, it shows that it is possible to conceive of a difference between access and sentience. Sentience without access might occur when you are engrossed in a conversation and suddenly realize that there is a jackhammer outside the window and that you have been hearing it, but not noticing it, for some time. Prior to the epiphany you were sentient of the noise but had no access to it. But Block admits that the examples are a bit strained, and suspects that in reality access and sentience go together. So we may not need a separate theory of where sentience occurs in the brain, how it fits into mental computation, or why it evolved. It seems to be an extra quality of some kinds of information access. What we do need is a theory of how the subjective qualities of sentience emerge out of mere information access. To complete the story, then, I must present a theory that addresses questions like these: If we could ever duplicate the information processing in the human mind as an enormous computer program, would a computer running the program be conscious? 146 I What if we took that program and trained a large number of people, say, the population of China, to hold in mind the data and act out the steps? Would there be one gigantic consciousness hovering overt China, separate from the consciousnesses of the billion individuals? If they were implementing the brain state for agonizing pain, would there be some entity that really was in pain, even if every citizen was cheerful and lighthearted? Suppose the visual receiving area at the back of your brain was surgically severed from the rest and remained alive in your skull, receiving input from the eyes. By every behavioral measure you are blind. Is there a mute but fully aware visual consciousness sealed off in the back of your head? What if it was removed and kept alive in a dish?

But when A and B are both on, we have too much of a good thing A-xor-B is screaming its head off just when we want it to shut up. If we try smaller weights or a higher threshold, we can keep it quiet when A and B are both on, but then, unfortunately, it will be quiet when just A or just B is on. You can experiment with your own weights and you will see that nothing works. Exclusive-or is just one of many demons that cannot be built out of perceptrons; others include demons to determine whether an even or an odd number of units are on, to determine whether a string of active units is symmetrical, and to get the answer to a simple addition problem. The solution is to make the network less of a stimulus-response creature and give it an internal representation between the input and output layers. It needs a representation that makes the crucial kinds of information about the inputs explicit, so that each output unit really can just add 110 I up its inputs and get the right answer. Here is how it can be done for exclusive-or: Cy) AxorB .6/ NO2 (AorB) (5), Y5) (AandB) .6 >v -4 The two hidden units between the input and the output calculate useful intermediate products. The one on the left computes the simple case of "A or B," which in turn simply excites the output node. The one on the right computes the vexing case of "A and B," and it inhibits the output node. The output node can simply compute "(A or B) and not (A and B)," which is well within its feeble powers. Note that even at the microscopic level of building the simplest demons out of toy neurons, internal representations are indispensable; stimulus-response connections are not enough. Even better, a hidden-layer network can be trained to set its own weights, using a fancier version of the perceptron learning procedure. As before, a teacher gives the network the correct output for every input, and the network adjusts the connection weights up or down to try to reduce the difference. But that poses a problem the perceptron did not have to worry about: how to adjust the connections from the input units to the hidden units. It is problematic because the teacher, unless it is1 a mind reader, has no way of knowing the "correct" states for the hidden units, which are sealed inside the network. The psychologists David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and Ronald Williams hit on a clever solution. The output units propagate back to each hidden unit a signal that represents the sum of the hidden units errors across all the output units it connects to ("youre sending too much activation," or "youre sending too little activation," and by what amount). That signal can serve as a surrogate teaching signal which may be used to adjust the hidden layers inputs. The connections from the input layer to each hidden unit can be nudged up or down to reduce the hidden units tendency to overshoot or undershoot, given the current input pattern. This procedure, called "error back-propagation" or simply "backprop," can be iterated backwards to any number of layers.

In a way, we have come full circle, because a hidden-layer network is like', 'and increasing the weight '),

In some ways this is reminiscent of the mind. We do not need predefined retrieval tags for items in memory; almost any aspect of an object can bring the entire object to mind. For example, we can recall "vegetable" upon thinking about things that are green and leafy or green and crunchy or leafy and crunchy. A visual example is our ability to complete a word from a few of its fragments. We do not see this figure as random line segments or even as an arbitrary sequence of letters like MIHB, but as something more probable: Thinking Machines 105 A second selling point, called "graceful degradation," helps deal with noisy input or hardware failure.

In Woody Allens Take the Money and Run, the bank robber Virgil Starkwell is foiled by his penmanship when the teller asks him why he wrote that he is pointing a gub at her. In a Gary Larson cartoon that adorns the office door of many a cognitive psychologist, a pilot flying over a castaway on a desert island reads the message scratched in the sand and shouts into his radio, "Wait! Wait!Cancel that, I guess it says HELF." Real-life humans do better, perhaps because we are fitted with auto-associators that use a preponderance of mutually consistent pieces of information to override one unusual piece. "Pritn" would activate the more familiar pattern "print"; "gub" would be warped to "gun," "HELF" to "HELP." Similarly, a computer with a single bad bit on its disk, a smidgen of corrosion in one of its sockets, or a brief dip in its supply of power can lock up and crash. But a human being who is tired, hung over, or brain-damaged does not lock up and crash; usually he or she is slower and less accurate but can muster an intelligible response. A third advantage is that auto-associators can do a simple version of the kind of computation called constraint satisfaction. Many problems that humans solve have a chicken-and-egg character. An example from Chapter 1 is that we compute the lightness of a surface from a guess about its angle and compute the angle of the surface from a guess about its lightness, without knowing either for sure beforehand. These problems abound in perception, language, and common-sense reasoning. Am I looking at a fold or at an edge? Am I hearing the vowel [I] (as in pin) or the vowel [e] (as in pen) with a southern accent? Was I the victim of an act of malice or an act of stupidity? These ambiguities can sometimes be resolved by choosing the interpretation that is consistent with the greatest number of interpretations of other ambiguous events, if they could all be resolved at once. For example, if one speech sound can be interpreted as either send or sinned, and another as either pen or pin, I can resolve the uncertainties if I hear one speaker utter both words with the same vowel sound. He must have intended send and pen, I would reason, 106 because send a pen is the only guess that does not violate soime constraint.

(147, 25, 2, 'as if it had two kinds The Minds Eye 261 of forms with blanks to be filled in. The form for a piece of surface has blanks for depth, for slant (how much the surface leans backward or forward), for tilt (how much it lists left or right), and for color, plus a label for which surface it is seen as belonging to. The form for a piece of edge has boxes to be checked, indicating whether it is at the boundary of an object, a groove, or a ridge, plus a dial for its orientation, which also shows (in the case of an object boundary) which side belongs to the surface that "owns" the boundary and which side is merely the backdrop. Of course, we wont literally find bureaucratic forms in the head. The diagram is a composite that depicts the kinds of information in the 2V2-D sketch. The brain presumably uses clusters of neurons and their activities to hold the information, and they may be distributed across different patches of cortex as a collection of maps that are accessed in register. Why do we see in two and a half dimensions? Why not a model in the head? The costs and benefits of storage give part of the answer. Any computer user knows that graphics files are voracious consumers of storage space. Rather than agglomerating the incoming gigabytes into a composite model, which would be obsolete as soon as anything moved, the brain lets the world itself store the information that falls outside a glance. Our heads crane, our eyes flit, and a new, up-to-date sketch is loaded in. As for the second-class status of the third dimension, it is almost inevitable. Unlike the other two dimensions, which announce themselves in the rods and cones that are currently active, depth must be painstakingly wrung out of the data. The stereo, contour, shading, and motion experts that work on computing depth are equipped to send along information about distance, slant, tilt, and occlusion relative to the viewer, not 3-D coordinates in the world. The best they can do is to pool their efforts to give us a two-and-a-half-dimensional acquaintance with the surfaces in front of our eyes. Its up to the rest of the brain to figure out how to use it. FRAMES OF REFERENCE The 272-D sketch is the masterwork of the ingeniously designed, harmoniously running machinery of the visual system. It has only one problem. As delivered, it is useless. Information in the 2V2-D array is specified in a retinal frame of reference, a coordinate system centered on the viewer. If a particular cell 262 I says, "Theres an edge here," what "here" means is the position of that cell on the retina say, dead straight ahead where youre looking. That would be fine if you were a tree looking at another tree, but as soon as something moves your eyes, your head, your body, a sighted object the information lurches to a new resting place in the array. Any part of the brain being guided by information in the array would find that its information is now defunct. If your hand was being guided toward the center of the visual field because that spot had contained an apple, the hand would now be heading toward empty space. If yesterday you memorized an image of your car as you were looking at its door handle, today the image would not match your view of the fender; the two views would barely overlap.

(148, 26, 2, 'but here is a preview. Surfaces are evenly colored and textured (that is, covered with regular grain, weave, or pockmarking), so a gradual change in the markings on a surface is caused by lighting and perspective. The world often contains parallel, symmetrical, regular, right-angled figures lying on the flat ground, which only appear to taper in tandem; the tapering is written off as an effect of perspective. Objects have regular, compact silhouettes, so if Object A has a bite taken out that is filled by Object B, A is behind B; accidents dont happen in which a bulge in B fits flush into the bite in A, You can feel the force of the assumptions in these line drawings, which convey an impression of depth. In practice, realist painters do not daub paint on windows but use visual images from memory and a host of tricks to accomplish the same thing on a canvas. They use grids made of wire or etched in glass, taut strings running from the scene through pinholes in the canvas to a viewing reticle, the camera obscura, the camera lucida, and now the camera Nikon. And, of course, no painter reproduces every hair of the dog. Brush strokes, the texture of the canvas, and the shape of the frame make a painting depart from the idealization of Leonardos window. Also, we almost always see a painting from a vantage point different from the one the painter assumed in front of his window, and this makes the sheaf of light rays impaling the eye different from the one the real scene would send out. That is why paintings are only partly illusory: we see what the painting depicts, but we simultaneously see it as a painting, not as reality. The canvas and frame tip us off, and remarkably, we use these very clues about pjcturehood to ascertain our vantage point relative to the painting 218 and to compensate for its difference from the painters. We undo the distortion of the picture as if seeing it from the painters perspective, and interpret the adjusted shapes correctly. The compensation works only up to a point. When we arrive late to a movie and sit in the front row, the difference between our vantage point and the cameras (analogous to the painter at Leonardos window) is too much of a stretch, and we see warped actors slithering across a trapezoid. There is another difference between art and life. The painter had to sight the scene from a single vantage point. The viewer peeps at the world from two vantage points: his left eyes and his right eyes. Hold out a finger and remain still while you close one eye, then the other. The finger obscures different parts of the world behind it. The two eyes have slightly different views, a fact of geometry called binocular parallax. Many kinds of animals have two eyes, and whenever they aim forward, so that their fields overlap (rather than aiming outward for a panoramic view), natural selection must have faced the problem of combining their pictures into a unified image that die rest of the brain can use. That hypothetical image is named after a mythical creature with a single eye in the middle of its forehead: the Cyclops, a member of a race of monocular giants encountered by Odysseus in his travels. The problem in making a cyclopean image is that there is no direct way to overlay the views of the two eyes. Most objects fall on different places in the two images, and the difference depends on how far', 'but here is a '),

Fifth, we dont immediately see "objects," the movable hunks of matter that we count, classify, and label with nouns. As far as vision is concerned, its not even clear what an object is. When David Marr considered how to design a computer vision system that finds objects, he was forced to ask: The Minds Eye j 259 Is a nose an object? Is a head one? Is it still one if it is attached to a body? What about a man on horseback? These questions show that the difficulties in trying to formulate what should be recovered as a region from an image are so great as to amount almost to philosophical problems. There is really no answer to them all these things can be an object if you want to think of them that way, or they can be part of a larger object. A drop of Krazy Glue can turn two objects into one, but the visual system has no way of knowing that. We have, however, an almost palpable sense of surfaces and the boundaries between them. The most famous illusions in psychology come from the brains unflagging struggle to carve the visual field into surfaces and to decide which is in front of the other. One example is the Rubin face-vase, which flips between a goblet and a pair of profiles tetea- tete. The faces and vase cannot be seen at the same time (even if one imagines two men holding up a goblet between their noses), and whichever shape predominates "owns" the border as its demarcating line, relegating the other patch to an amorphous backdrop. D Another is the Kanisza triangle, a stretch of nothingness that blocks out a shape as real as if it had inscribed it in ink. II V ~7 The faces, vase, and triangle are familiar objects, but the illusions do not depend on their familiarity; meaningless blobs are just as compelling. I 260 We perceive surfaces involuntarily, impelled by information surging up from our retinas; contrary to popular belief, we do not see what we expect to see. So what is the product of vision? Marr called it a 2V2-D sketch; others call it a visible surface representation. Depth is whimsically downgraded to half a dimension because it does not define the medium in which visual information is held (unlike the left-right and high-low dimensions); it is just a piece of information held in that medium. Think of the toy made of hundreds of sliding pins which you press against a 3-D surface (such as a face), forming a template of the surface in the contour of the pins on the other side. The contour has three dimensions, but they are not created equal. Position from side to side and position from top to bottom are defined by particular pins; position in depth is defined by how far a pin protrudes. For any depth there may be many pins; for any pin there is only one depth. The 2/2-D sketch looks a bit like this: It is a mosaic of cells or pixels, each dedicated to a line of sight from the cyclopean eyes vantage point. It is wider than it is tall because our two eyes sit side by side in our skulls rather than one being above the other. The cells are smaller in the center of the visual field than in the periphery because our resolution is greater in the center. Each cell can represent information about a surface or about an', 'can be curved in '),

When you look behind the picture, the sailboats seem closer than the arches because their misbuttoned lines of sight meet in a nearer plane.

Slowly move the book away while keeping your eyes relaxed and "looking through" the book to an imaginary point The Minds Eye 227 beyond it. (Some people place a pane of glass or a transparency on top of the stereogram, so they can focus on the reflections of distant objects.) You should still be seeing double. The trick is to let one of the double images drift on top of the other, and then to keep them there as if they were magnets. Try to keep the images aligned. The superimposed shapes should gradually come into focus and pop in or out to different depths. As Tyler has noted, stereo vision is like love: if youre not sure, youre not experiencing it. Some people have better luck holding a finger a few centimeters in front of the stereogram, focusing on the finger, and then removing it while keeping the eyes converged to that depth. With this technique, the false fusion comes from the eyes crossing so that the left eye sights a boat on the right while the right eye sights a boat on the left. Dont worry about what your mother said; your eyes will not freeze into that position forever. Whether you can fuse stereograms with your eyes crossed too much or not enough probably depends on whether you are slightly crosseyed or wall-eyed to begin with. With practice, most people can fuse wallpaper autostereograms. They do not need the yogi-like concentration of the psychologists who freefuse the two-picture stereograms, because they do not have to uncouple their focusing reflex from their convergence reflex to the same degree. Free-fusing a two-picture stereogram requires jamming your eyes far enough apart that each eye remains aimed at one of the pictures. Fusing a wallpaper stereogram requires merely keeping the eyes far enough apart that each eye remains aimed at neighboring clones inside a single picture. The clones are close enough together that the convergence angle is not too far out of line from what the focusing reflex wants it to be. It shouldnt be too hard for you to exploit this small wiggle in the mesh between the two reflexes and focus a wee bit closer than your eyes converge. If it is, Ellen DeGeneres may be able to get you into her support group. The trick behind the wallpaper stereogram identical drawings luring the eyes into mismatching their views uncovers a fundamental problem the brain has to solve to see in stereo. Before it can measure the positions of a spot on the two retinas, the brain has to be sure that the 228 spot on one retina came from the same mark in the world as the spot on the other retina. If the world had only one mark in it, it would be easy. But add a second mark, and their retinal images can be matched in two ways: spot 1 in the left eye with spot 1 in the right eye, and spot 2', 'designed by Ilavenil Subbiah. '),

We avoid biting into a plaster apple because the color tips us off that it is not made of fruit flesh. Analyzing matter from the light it reflects is a job for a reflectance specialist. Different kinds of matter reflect back different wavelengths of light in different amounts. (To keep things simple, Ill stay in black and white; color is, roughly, the same problem multiplied by three.) 246 Unfortunately, a given amount of reflected light could have come from an infinite number of combinations of matter and lighting. One hundred units of light could have come from coal reflecting back 10% of the light of 1,000 candles or from snow reflecting back 90% of the light of 111 candles. So there is no foolproof way to deduce an objects material from its reflected light. The lightness analyzer must somehow factor out the level of illumination. This is another ill-posed problem, exactly equivalent to this one: I give you a number, you tell me which two numbers were multiplied to get it. The problem can be solved only by adding in assumptions. A camera is faced with the same task how to render the snowball as white whether it is indoors or out. A cameras meter, which controls the amount of light Teaching the film, embodies two assumptions. The first is that lighting is uniform: the whole scene is in sun, or in shade, or under a lightbulb. When the assumption is violated, the snapshooter is disappointed. Aunt Mimi is a muddy silhouette against the blue sky because the camera is fooled by her face being in shade while the sky is lit directly by the sun. The second assumption is that the scene is, on average, medium gray. If you throw together a random collection of objects, their many colors and lightnesses will usually average out to a medium shade of gray that reflects back 18% of the light. The camera "assumes" il is looking at an average scene and lets in just enough light to make the middle of the range of lightnesses in the scene come out as medium gray on the film. Patches that are lighter than the middle arc rendered pale gray and white; patches that are darker, deep gray and black. But when the assumption is wrong and the scene does not really average out to gray, the camera is fooled. A picture of a black cat on black velvet comes out medium gray, a picture of a polar bear on the snow comes out medium gray, and so on. A skilled photographer analyzes how a scene differs from the average scene and uses various tricks to compensate. A crude but effective one is to carry around a standard medium gray card (which reflects back exactly 18% of the light), lean it on the subject, and aim the meter at the card.

But Campbell echoed millennia of wise men and women when he summed up the research: "The direct pursuit of happiness is a recipe for an unhappy life." THE SIRENS SONG When we say that someone is led by emotion rather than reason, we often mean that the person sacrifices long-term interests for short-term gratification. Losing ones temper, surrendering to a seducer, blowing ones paycheck, and turning tail at the dentists door are examples. What makes us so short-sighted:1 The ability to defer a reward is called self-control or delay of gratification. Social scientists often treat it as a sign of intelligence, of the ability to anticipate the future and plan accordingly. But discounting the future, as economists call it, is part of the logic of choice for any agent that lives longer than an instant. Going for the quick reward instead of a distant payoff is often the rational strategy. Which is better, a dollar now or a dollar a year from now? (Assume there is no inflation.) A dollar now, you might say, because you can invest it and have more than a dollar in a year. Unfortunately, the explanation is circular: the reason that interest exists in the first place is to pay people to give up the dollar that they would rather have now than a year from now. But economists point out that even if the explanation is misplaced, the answer is right: now really is better. First, a dollar now is available if a pressing need or opportunity arises in less than a year. Second, if you forgo the dollar now, you have no guarantee that you will get it back a year from now. Third, you might die within a year and never get to enjoy it. It is rational, therefore, to discount the future: to consume a resource now unless investing it brings a high enough return. The interest rate you 394 J should demand depends on how important the money is to you now, how likely you are to get it back, and how long you expect to live. The struggle to reproduce is a kind of economy, and all organisms, even plants, must "decide" whether to use resources now or save them for the future. Some of these decisions are made by the body. We grow frail with age because our genes discount the future and build strong young bodies at the expense of weak old ones. The exchange pays off over the generations because an accident may cause the body to die before it gets old, in which case any sacrifice of vigor for longevity would have gone to waste. But most decisions about the future are made by the mind. At every moment we choose, consciously or unconsciously, between good things now and better things later. Sometimes the rational decision is "now," particularly when, as the sayings go, life is short or there is no tomorrow. The logic is laid bare in firing-squad jokes. The condemned man is offered the ceremonial last cigarette and responds, "No thanks, Im trying to quit." We laugh because we know it is pointless for him to delay gratification.

An emotion that is guaranteed not to be a sham because it has physiological costs like tachycardia, insomnia, and anorexia. An emotion like romantic love. "People who are sensible about love are incapable of it," wrote Douglas Yates. Even when courted by the perfect suitor, people are unable to will themselves to fall in love, often to the bewilderment of the matchmaker, the suitor, and the person himself or herself. Instead it is a glance, a laugh, a manner that steals the heart. Remember from Chapter 2 that spouses of one twin are not attracted to the other; we fall in love with the individual, not with the individuals qualities. The upside is that when Cupid does strike, the lovestruck one is all the more credible in the eyes of the object of desire. Murmuring that your lovers looks, earning power, and IQ meet your minimal standards would probably kill the romantic mood, even though the statement is statistically true. The way to a persons heart is to declare the opposite that youre in love because you cant help it. Tipper Gores Parents Music Resource Center notwithHotheads 419 standing, the sneering, body-pierced, guitar-smashing rock musician is typically not singing about drugs, sex, or Satan. He is singing about love. He is courting a woman by calling attention to the irrationality, uncontrollability, and physiological costs of his desire. I want you so bad, its driving me mad, Cant eat, cant sleep, Heart beats like a big bass drum, Youre the only one, Dont know why I love you like I do, You drive me crazy, Cant stop lovinyou, Aint nobody can do it to me the way you can, I like the way you walk, I like the way you talk, et cetera, et cetera. Of course, one can well imagine a woman not being swept off her feet by these proclamations. (Or a man, if it is a woman doing the declaring.)

Schelling points out that the trick to coming out ahead is "a voluntary but irreversible sacrifice of freedom of choice." How do you persuade 410 someone that you will not pay more than $ 16,000 for a car that is really worth $20,000 to you? You can make a public, enforceable $5,000 bet with a third party that you wont pay more than $16,000. As long as $16,000 gives the dealer a profit, he has no choice but to accept. Persuasion would be futile; its against your interests to compromise. By tying your own hands, you improve your bargaining position. The example is fanciful, but real ones abound. The dealer appoints a salesperson who is not authorized to sell at less than a certain price even if he says he wants to. A homebuyer cannot get a mortgage if the banks appraiser says he paid too much. The homebuyer exploits that powerlessness to get a better price from the seller. Not only can power be a liability in conflicts of strategy, communication can be, too. When you are haggling from a pay phone with a friend about where to meet for dinner, you can simply announce that you will be at Mings at six-thirty and hang up. The friend has to accede if she wants to meet you at all. Paradoxical tactics also enter into the logic of promises. A promise can secure a favor only when the beneficiary of the promise has good reason to believe it will be carried out. The promiser is thus in a better position when the beneficiary knows that the promiser is bound by his promise. The law gives companies the right to sue and the right to be sued. The right to be sued? What kind of "right" is that? It is a right that confers the power to make a promise: to enter into contracts, borrow money, and engage in business with someone who might be harmed as a result. Similarly, the law that empowers banks to foreclose on a mortgage makes it worth the banks while to grant the mortgage, and so, paradoxically, benefits the borrower. In some societies, Schelling notes, eunuchs got the best jobs because of what they could not do. How does a hostage persuade his kidnapper not to kill him to prevent him from identifying the kidnapper in court? One option is to deliberately blind himself. A better one is to confess to a shameful secret that the kidnapper can use as blackmail. If he has noshameful secret, he can create one by having the kidnapper photograph him in some unspeakably degrading act. Threats, and defenses against threats, are the arena in which Dr. Strangelove really comes into his own. There are boring threats, in which the threatener has an interest in carrying out the threat for example, when a homeowner threatens a burglar that she will call the police. The fun begins when carrying out the threat is costly to the threatener, so its value is only as a deterrent. Again, freedom is costly; the threat is credible Hotheads 411 only when the threatener has no choice but to carry it out and the target knows it. Otherwise, the target can threaten the threatener right back by refusing to comply. The Doomsday Machine is an obvious example, though the secrecy defeated its purpose.

The nineteenth century had the baroness George Sand smoking a cigar in trousers and Oscar 502 Wilde in knee breeches with long hair and a sunflower. In the last half of the twentieth century conspicuous outrage has become the convention, and we have been treated to a tedious parade of rebels, outlaws, wild ones, bohemians, freaks, punks, shock jocks, gender-benders, mau-maus, bad boys, gangstas, sex divas, bitch goddesses, vamps, tramps, and material girls. Hipness has replaced classiness as the motor of fashion, but the status psychology is the same. Trend-setters are members of upper classes who adopt the styles of lower classes to differentiate themselves from middle classes, who wouldnt be caught dead in lower-class styles because theyre the ones in danger of being mistaken for them. The style trickles downward, sending the hip off in search of a new form of outrage. As the media and the merchandisers learn to market each new wave more efficiently, the avant-garde merry-go-round goes faster and more furiously. A regular feature of urban newspapers is the favorable notice of an "alternative" band followed by haughty letters advising that they were good when few had heard of them but that they have now sold out. Tom Wolfes mordant social commentaries {The Painted Word, From Bauhaus to Our House, Radical Chic) document how a thirst for status in the form of hipness drives the worlds of art, architecture, and the politics of the cultural elite. FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES People bestow favors on one another even when they are unrelated and have no sexual interest. It is easy to understand why even the most selfish organism might want to do so. If favors are traded, both parties profit as long as the value of what they get is greater to them than the value of what they give up. A clear example is a commodity whose benefit shows diminishing returns. If I have two pounds of meat and no fruit, and you have two pounds of fruit and no meat, the second pound of meat is worth less to me than the first (since theres only so much meat I can eat at a sitting), and you feel the same way about your second pound of fruit. Were both better off if we exchange a pound for a pound. Economists call the benefit a gain in trade. When traders exchange goods simultaneously, cooperation is easy. If the other guy is reneging, you hang on to your meat or grab it back. Most favors, however, cannot be retracted, such as sharing information, saving a drowning person, or helping in a fight. Also, most favors cannot change hands at Family Values 503 the same time. Needs may change; if I help you now in return for protection of my unborn child, I cannot collect until the child is born. And surpluses often are staggered; if you and I have just felled antelopes, theres no point in trading identical carcasses. Only if you felled one today and I fell one in a month does it make sense to trade. Money is one solution, but it is a recent invention and could not have figured in our evolution. As we saw in Chapter 6, the problem with delayed exchanges, or reciprocation, is that its possible to cheat, to accept a favor now and not return it later. Obviously everyone would be better off if no one cheated. But as long as the other guy might cheat (which is inevitable when individuals can', 'It says so talented '),
(157, 35, 2, 'like cubes and gems are composed of slanted faces, so recovering the slants is a way to ascertain their shape. In fact, any shape can be thought of as a carving made up of millions of tiny facets. Even when the surface is smoothly curved so the "facets" shrink to points, the shading law applies to the light coming off each point. If the law could be run backwards, our shading analyzer could apprehend the shape of a surface by registering the slant of the tangent plane resting on each point, Unfortunately, a given amount of light reflecting off a patch could have come from a dark surface angled toward the light or from a light surface angled away. So there is no foolproof way to recover a surfaces angle from the light it reflects without making additional assumptions. A first assumption is that surface lightness is uniform: the world is made of plaster. When surfaces are unevenly pigmented, the assumption is violated, and our shading analyzer should be fooled. It is. Paintings and photographs are the most obvious example. A less obvious one is countershading in animal camouflage. The hides of many animals lighten from hack to belly in a gradient that cancels out the effects of light on their 3-D shapes. This flattens the animal, making it harder to detect by the assumption-making, shape-from-shading analyzer in the brain of a predator. Makeup is another example. When applied in sub-Tammy Faye Bakker amounts, pigment on the skin can fool the beholder into seeing The Minds Eye 249 the flesh and bone as having a more ideal shape. Dark blush on the sides of the nose makes them look as if they are at a shallower angle to the light, which makes the nose appear narrower. White powder on the upper Up works the other way: the lip seems to intercept the light source head-on as if it were Fuller, bestowing that desirable pouty look. The sh ape-from-s hading analyzer has to make other assumptions, too. Surfaces in the world are made of thousands of materials, and light bounces off their slanted surfaces in very different ways. A matte surface like chalk or dull paper follows a simple law, and the brains shading analyzer often seems to assume that the world is matte. Surfaces with glosses, patinas, fuzz, pits, and prickles do other, stranger things with light, and they can fool the eye. A famous example is the full moon. It looks like a flat disk, but of course it is a sphere. We have no trouble seeing other spheres from their shading, like ping-pong balls, and any good artist can sketch a sphere with charcoal. The problem with the moon is that it is pockmarked with craters of all sizes, most too small to be discerned from the earth, and they combine into a surface that behaves differently from the matte ideal that our shading analyzer takes for granted. The center of the full moon faces the viewer flat-on, so it should be brightest, but it has little nooks and crannies whose walls are seen edge-on from the viewers earthly vantage point, making the center of the moon look darker. The surfaces near the perimeter of the moon graze the line of sight and should look darker, but they present their canyon walls face-on and reflect back lots of light, making the perimeter look lighter. Over the whole moon, the angle of its surface and the angles of the facets of its craters cancel out. All portions reflect back the same amount of', 'like cubes and gems '),
(158, 36, 2, 'live in a parallel universe scattered among bodies, with their own agendas. Most discussions of the biology of altruism are really not about the biology of altruism. Its easy to see why nature documentaries, with their laudable conservationist ethic, disseminate the agitprop that animals act in the interests of the group. One subtext is, Dont hate the wolf that just ate Bambi; hes acting for the greater good. The other is, Protecting the environment is natures way; we humans had better shape up. The opposing theory of the selfish gene has been bitterly attacked out of the fear that it vindicates the philosophy of Gordon Gekko in Wall Street: greed is good, greed works. Then there are those who believe in selfish genes but urge us to face up to the sad truth: at heart, Mother Teresa is really selfish. I think moralistic science is bad for morals and bad for science. Surely paving Yosemite is unwise, Gordon Gekko is bad, and Mother Teresa is good regardless of what came out in the latest biology journals. But I suppose it is only human to feel a frisson when learning about what made us what we are. So I offer a more hopeful way of reflecting on the selfish gene. The body is the ultimate barrier to empathy. Your toothache simply does not hurt me the way it hurts you. But genes are not imprisoned in bodies; the same gene lives in the bodies of many family members at once. The dispersed copies of a gene call to one another by endowing bodies with emotions. Love, compassion, and empathy are invisible fibers that connect genes in different bodies. They are the closest we will ever come to feeling someone elses toothache. When a parent wishes 402 she could take the place of a child about to undergo surgery, it is not the species or the group or her body that wants her to have that most unselfish emotion; it is her selfish genes. Animals are nice not just to their relatives. The biologist Robert Trivers developed a suggestion from George Williams on how another kind of altruism could evolve (where altruism, again, is defined as behavior that benefits another organism at a cost to the behaver). Dawkins explains it with a hypothetical example. Imagine a species of bird that suffers from a disease-carrying tick and must spend a good deal of time removing them with its beak. It can reach every part of its body but the top of its head. Every bird would benefit if some other bird groomed its head. If the birds in a group all responded to the sight of a head presented to them by grooming it, the group would prosper. But what would happen if a mutant presented its head for grooming but never groomed anyone else? These freeloaders would be parasite-free, and could use the time they saved not grooming others to look for food. With that advantage they would eventually dominate the population, even if it made the group more vulnerable to extinction. The psychologist Roger; Brown explains, "One can imagine a pathetic final act in which all birds on stage present to one another heads that none will groom." But say a different, grudge-bearing mutant arose. This mutant groomed strangers, groomed birds that in the past had groomed it, but refused to groom birds that had refused to groom it. Once a few of them had gained a toehold, these grudgers could prosper, because they would groom one another and not pay the costs of grooming the cheaters. And once they', 'live in a parallel '),
(159, 37, 2, 'of course not the visual field; "above" means "above the main geon," not "above the fovea." So the relations stay the same when the object or viewer moves. Geons are combinatorial, like grammar. Obviously we dont describe shapes to ourselves in words, but geon assemblies are a kind of internal language, a dialect of mentalese. Elements from a fixed vocabulary are fitted together into larger structures, like words in a phrase or sentence. A sentence is not the sum of its words but depends on their syntactic arrangement; A man bites a dog is not the same as A dog bites a man. Likewise, an object is not the sum of its geons but depends on their spatial arrangement; a cylinder with an elbow on the side is a cup, while a The Minds Eye 271 cylinder with an elbow at the top is a pail. And just as a small number of words and rules combine into an astronomical number of sentences, a small number of geons and attachments combine into an astronomical number of objects. According to Biederman, each of the twenty-four geons comes in fifteen sizes and builds (a bit fatter, a bit skinnier), and there are eighty-one ways to join them. That allows for 10,497,600 objects built out of two geons, and 306 billion objects made of three geons. In theory, that should be more than enough to fit the tens of thousands of shapes we know. In practice, its easy to build instantly recognizable models of everyday objects out of three, and often only two, geons. Language and complex shapes even seem to be neighbors in the brain. The left hemisphere is not only the seat of language but also the seat of the ability to recognize and imagine shapes defined by arrangements of parts. A neurological patient who had suffered a stroke to his left hemisphere reported, "When I try to imagine a plant, an animal, an object, I can recall but one part. My inner vision is fleeting, fragmented; if Im asked to imagine the head of a cow, I know it has ears and horns, but I cant revisualize their places." The right hemisphere, in contrast, is good for measuring whole shapes; it can easily judge whether a rectangle is taller than it is wide or whether a dot lies more or less than an inch from an object. One advantage of the geon theory is that its demands on the 272-D sketch are not unreasonable. Carving objects into parts, labeling the parts as geons, and ascertaining their arrangement are not insurmountable problems, and vision researchers have developed models of how the brain might solve them. Another advantage is that a description of an objects anatomy helps the mind to think about objects, not just to blurt out their names. People understand how objects work and what they are for by analyzing the shapes and arrangements of their parts. The geon theory says that at the highest levels of perception the mind "sees" objects and parts as idealized geometric solids. That would explain a curious and long-noted fact about human visual aesthetics. Anyone who has been to a figure-drawing class or a nude beach quickly learns that real human bodies do not live up to our sweet imaginations. Most of us look better in clothes. In his history of fashion, the art historian Quentin Bell gives an explanation that could have come right out of the geon theory: 272 J If we wrap an object in some kind of envelope, so that the eyes infer rather than see the object that', 'of course not the '),
(160, 38, 2, 'of their splotches appears in several positions.) Second, a dot in one eye should be matched with no more than one dot in the other. That means that a line of sight from one eye is assumed to end at a splotch on one and only one surface in the world. At first glance it looks as if the assumption rules out a line of sight passing through a transparent surface to an opaque one, like the bottom of a shallow lake. But the assumption is more subtle; it only rules out the coincidence in which two identical splotches, one on the lakes surface and one on the bottom, line up one behind the other from the left eyes vantage point while both being visible from the right eyes. Third, matter is cohesive and smooth. Most of the time a line of sight will end up on a surface in the world that is not drastically closer or farther than the surface hit by the neighboring line of sight. That is, neighboring patches of the world tend to lie on the same smooth surface. Of course, at the boundary of an object the assumption is violated: the edge of the back cover of this book is a couple of feet away from you, but if you glance just to its right you might be looking at the moon a quarter of a million miles away. But boundaries make up a small portion of the visual field (you need much less ink to sketch a line drawing than to color it in), and these exceptions can be tolerated. What the assumption rules out is a world made up of dust storms, swarms of gnats, fine wires, deep crevasses between craggy peaks, beds of nails viewed point-on, and so on. The assumptions sound reasonable in the abstract, but something still has to find the matches that satisfy them. Chicken-and-egg probTrie Minis Eye 235 terns can sometimes be solved with the technique called constraint satisfaction that we met in Chapter 2 when looking at Necker cubes and accented speech. When the parts of a puzzle cannot be solved one at a time, the puzzle-solver can keep in mind several guesses for each one, compare the guesses for the different parts of the puzzle, and sec which ones are mutually consistent. A good analogy is working on a crossword puzzle with a pencil and an eraser. Often a clue for a horizontal word is so vague that several words can be penciled in, and a clue for a vertical word is so vague that several words can be penciled in. But if only one of the vertical guesses shares a letter with any of the horizontal guesses, that pair of words is kept and the others are erased. Imagine doing that for all the clues and squares at once and you have the idea of constraint satisfaction. In the case of solving the correspondence problem in stereo vision, the dots are the clues, the matchups and their depths are the guesses, and the three assumptions about the world are Jike the rules that say that every letter of even word must sit in a box, every box must have a letter in it, and all the sequences of letters must spell out words. Constraint satisfaction can sometimes be implemented in a constraint network like the one I presented on page 107.

Every gene contributing to a trait is embodied in many individuals in many generations, so if one individual with the gene dies childless, the success of many others with the gene can make up for it. Imagine a game of Russian roulette where if you dont get killed you have one more offspring. A gene for joining in the game could be selected, because five-sixths of the time it would leave an extra copy in the gene pool and one-sixth of the time it would leave none. On average, that yields .83 more copies than staying out of the game. Joining a coalition of five other men that is certain to capture five women but suffer one fatality is in effect the same choice. The key idea is that the coalition acting together can gain a benefit that its members acting alone cannot, and that spoils are distributed according to the risks undertaken. (There are several complications, but they do not change the point.) In fact, if the spoils are certain and divided up fairly, the level of danger doesnt matter. Say your coalition has eleven members and can ambush an enemy coalition of five, taking their women. If one member of your coalition is likely to be killed, you have a ten-in-eleven chance of surviving, which would entitle you to a one-in-two chance (five captive women, ten men) of gaining a wife, an expected gain of .45 wives (averaged over many situations with these payoffs). If two members will be killed, you have a smaller chance of surviving (nine in eleven), but if you do survive you have a larger chance of gaining a wife, since your dead allies wont be taking theirs. The average gain (9/11 x 5/9) is the same, .45 wives. Even if six members are likely to be killed, so that your survival odds fall to less than even (five in eleven), the spoils are divided fewer ways (five women among five victors), so if you $urvive you are guaranteed a wife, for an expected gain, once again, of .45 wives. Family Values 515 Tooby and Cosmides calculations assume that a mans children can do just fine when he is dead, so the loss of fitness with death is zero, not negative. Of course that is not true, but they point out that if the group is relatively prosperous the fatherless childrens survival chances may not diminish too much and it still could pay men to raid. They predict that men should be more willing to fight when their group is secure in food than when it is hungry, contrary to the protein-shortage hypothesis. The data bear them out. Another implication is that females should never have an interest in starting a war (even if they had weapons or allies that made up for their smaller size). The reason that females never evolved an appetite to band together and raid neighboring villages for husbands is that a womans reproductive success is rarely limited by the number of available males, so any risk to her life while pursuing additional mates is a sheer loss in expected fitness. (Foraging women do, however, encourage men to fight in defense of the group and to avenge slain family members.) The theory also explains why in modern warfare most people are unwilling to send women into combat and feel morally outraged when women are casualties, even though no ethical argument makes a womans life more precious than a mans. It is hard to shake the intuition that war is a game that benefits men (which', 'that increase fitness on '),
(162, 40, 2, 'the closer the object the farther apart its facsimiles lie in the two eyes projections. Imagine looking at an apple on a table, with a lemon behind it and cherries in front. Your eyes are aimed at the apple, so its image lands on each eyes fovea (the dead center of the retina, where vision is sharpest). The apple is at six oclock in both retinas. Now look at the projections of the cherries, which are nearer. In the left eye they sit at seven oclock, but in the right eye they sit at five oclock, not seven. The lemon, which is farther, projects an image at five-thirty in the left eye but at six-thirty in the right eye. Objects closer than the point of fixation wander outward toward the temples; objects that are farther squeeze inward toward the nose. But the impossibility of a simple overlay presented evolution with an opportunity. With a bit of high school trigonometry, one can use the difference in an objects projection in the two eyes, together with the angle formed by the two eyes gaze and their separation in the skull, to calculate how far away the object is. If natural selection could wire up a neural computer to do the trig, a two-eyed creature could shatter Leonardos window and sense an objects depth. The mechanism is called stereoscopic vision, stereo for short. Incredibly, for thousands of years no one noticed. Scientists thought that animals have two eyes for the same reason they have two kidneys: as a by-product of a bilaterally symmetrical body plan, and perhaps so that one could serve as a spare if the other got damaged. The possibility of stereo vision escaped Euclid, Archimedes, and Newton, and even Leonardo did not fully appreciate it. He did notice that the two eyes have different views of a sphere, the left eye seeing slightly farther around it on the left and the right eye seeing farther around it on the right. If only he had used a cube in his example instead of a sphere, he would have noticed that the shapes on the retinas are different. Stereo vision was not discovered until 1838, by Charles Wheatstone, a physicist and inventor after whom the "Wheatstone bridge" electrical circuit is named. Wheatstone wrote: It will now be obvious why it is impossible for the artist to give a faithful representation of any near solid object, that is, to produce a painting which shall not be distinguished in the mind from the object itself. When the painting and the object are seen with both eyes, in the case of the painting two similar pictures are projected on the retinae, in the case of the solid object the two pictures are dissimilar; there is therefore an essential difference between the impressions on the organs of sensation in the two cases, and consequently between the perceptions formed in the mind; the painting therefore cannot be confounded with the solid object. 220 The late discovery of stereo vision is surprising, because it i& not hard to notice in everyday experience. Keep one eye closed for a few minutes as you walk around. The world is a flatter place, and you might find yourself grazing doorways and spooning sugar into your lap. Of course, the world does not flatten completely.

Why do men always lie down, when they can, on soft beds rather than on hard floors? Why do they sit round the stove on a cold day? Why, in a room, do they place themselves, ninety-nine times out of a hundred, with their faces towards its middle rather than to the wall? Why do they prefer saddle of mutton and champagne to hard-tack and pond-water? Why does the maiden interest the youth so that everything about her seems more important and significant than anything else in the world? Nothing more can be said than that these are human ways, and that every creature likes its own ways, and takes to the following them as a matter of course. Science may come and consider these ways, and find that most of them are useful. But it is not for the sake of their utility that they are followed, but because at the moment of following them we feel that that is the only appropriate and natural thing to do. Not one man in a billion, when taking his dinner, ever thinks of utility. He eats because the food tastes good and makes him want more. If you ask him why he should want to eat more of what tastes like that, instead of revering you as a philosopher we will probably laugh at you for a fool.And so, probably, does each animal feel about the particular things it tends to do in presence of particular objects. To the broody hen the notion would probably seem monstrous that there should be a creature in the world to whom a nestful of eggs was not the utterly fascinating and precious and never-to-be-too-much sat-upon object which it is to her. The human reactions described in the passage still may strike you as versions of animal instincts. What about our rational, flexible thought? Can it be explained as a set of instincts? In the preceding chapter I showed how our precision intelligence can be broken down into smaller and smaller agents or networks of information processing. At the lowest levels, the steps have to be as automatic and unanalyzed as the reactions of the most brutish animal. Remember what the tortoise said to Achilles. No rational creature can consult rules all the way down; that way infinite regress lies. At some point a thinker must execute a rule, because he just cant help it: its the human way, a matter of course, the only appropriate and natural thing to do in short, an instinct. When all goes well, our reasoning instincts link up into complex programs for rational analysis, but that is not because we somehow commune with a realm of truth and reason. The same instincts can be seduced by sophistry, bump up against 186 J paradoxes like Zenos beguiling demonstrations that motion is impossible, or make us dizzy as they ponder mysteries like sentience and free will. Just as an ethologist unmasks an animals instincts with clever manipulations of its world, such as slipping a mechanical bee into a hive or rearing a chick in a planetarium, psychologists can unmask human reasoning instincts by couching problems in devilish ways, as we shall see in Chapter 5.

If your memory for the shape say, a suitcase was a copy of the 2V2-D sketch when you first saw it, the moved version would no longer match. Your memory of a suitcase would be "a rectangular slab and a horizontal handle at twelve oclock," but the handle you are now looking at is not horizontal and not at twelve oclock. You would stare blankly, not knowing what it is. The Minds Eye 269 But suppose that instead of using the retinal reference frame, your memory file uses a frame aligned with the object itself. Your memory would be "a rectangular slab with a handle parallel to the edge of the slab, at the top of the slab." The "of the slab" part means that you remember the positions of the parts relative to the object itself, not relative to the visual field. Then, when you see an unidentified object, your visual system would automatically align a 3-D reference frame on it, just as it did with Attneaves chorus line of squares and triangles. Now when you match what you see with what you remember, the two coincide, regardless of how the suitcase is oriented. You recognize your luggage. That, in a nutshell, is how Marr explained shape recognition. The key idea is that a shape memory is not a copy of the 272-D sketch but rather is stored in a format that differs from it in two ways. First, the coordinate system is centered on the object not, as in the 2V2-D sketch, on the viewer. To recognize an object, the brain aligns a reference frame on its axes of elongation and symmetry and measures the positions and angles of the parts in that reference frame. Only then are vision and memory matched. The second difference is that the matcher does not compare vision and memory pixel by pixel, as if placing a jigsaw puzzle piece in a gap. If it did, shapes that ought to match still might not. Real objects 270 have dents and wobbles and come in different styles and models. No two suitcases have identical dimensions, and some have rounded or beefedup corners and fat or skinny handles. So the representation of the shape about to be matched shouldnt be an exact mold of every hill and valley. It should be couched in forgiving categories like "slab" and "U-shaped thingy." The attachments, too, cant be specified to the millimeter but have to allow for some slop: the handles of different cups are all "on the side," but they can be a bit higher or lower from cup to cup. The psychologist Irv Biederman has fleshed out Marrs two ideas with an inventory of simple geometric parts that he calls "geons" (by analogy to the protons and electrons making up atoms). Here are five geons along with some combinations: Biederman proposes twenty-four geons altogether, including a cone, a megaphone, a football, a tube, a cube, and a piece of elbow macaroni. (Technically, they are all just different kinds of cones. If an ice cream cone is the surface swept out by an expanding circle as its center is moved along a line, geons are the surfaces swept out by other 2-D shapes as they expand or contract while moving along straight or curved lines.) Geons can be assembled into objects with a few attachment relations like "above," "beside," "end to end," "end to off-center," and "parallel."

(165, 43, 2, 'the right side and he writes backwards with his left hand.) The only difference is that mere mortals should not be able to mentally rotate a shape in the fourth dimension, our mental space being strictly 3-D. All the versions should show an effect of tilt, unlike what we had found for 2-D shapes, where the mirror images did not. Thats what happened. The subtle difference between two- and three-dimensional 284 objects sewed up the case: the brain rotates shapes around an optimal axis in three dimensions, but no more than three dimensions. Mental rotation is clearly one of the tricks behind our ability to recognize objects. Mental rotation is another talent of our gifted visual systems, with a special twist. It does not merely analyze the contours coming in from the world, but creates some its own in the form of a ghostly moving image. This brings us to a final topic in the psychology of vision. IMAGINE THAT! What shape are a beagles ears? How many windows are in your living room? Whats darker, a Christmas tree or a frozen pea? Whats larger, a guinea pig or a gerbil? Does a lobster have a mouth? When a person stands up straight, is her navel above her wrist? If the letter D is turned on its back and put on top of a J, what does the combination remind you of? Most people say that they answer these questions using a "mental image." They visualize the shape, which feels like conjuring up a picture available for inspection in the minds eye. The feeling is quite unlike the experience of answering abstract questions, such as "What is your mothers maiden name?" or "What is more important, civil liberties or a lower rate of crime?" Mental imagery is the engine that drives our thinking about objects in space. To load a car with suitcases or rearrange the furniture, we imagine the different spatial arrangements before we try them. The anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon described an ingenious use of mental imagery by the Yanomamo Indians of the Amazon rainforest. They had blown smoke down the opening of an armadillo hole to asphyxiate the animal, and then had to figure out where to dig to extract it from its tunnel, which could run underground for hundreds of feet. One of the Yanomamo men hit on the idea of threading a long vine with a knot at the end down the hole as far as it would go. The other men kept their ears to the ground listening for the knot bumping the sides of the burrow so they could get a sense of the direction in which the burrow ran. The first man broke off the vine, pulled it out, laid it along the ground, and began to dig where the end of the vine lay. A few feet down they struck armadillo. Without The Minds Eye j 285 an ability to visualize the tunnel and the vine and armadillo inside it, the men would not have connected a sequence of threading, listening, yanking, breaking, measuring, and digging actions to an expectation of finding an animal corpse. In a joke we used to tell as children, two carpenters are hammering nails into the side of a house, and one asks the other why he is examining each nail as he takes it out of the box and throwing half of them away.

(166, 44, 2, 'the second below middle on the piano. The first overtone is a vibration at 128 cycles a second, twice the frequency of the fundamental. Played by itself, it sounds higher than the fundamental but with the same pitch; on the piano, it corresponds to the next C going up the keyboard, the C below middle C. The interval between the two notes is called an octave, and all people indeed, all mammals perceive tones separated by an octave as having the same quality of pitch. The second overtone vibrates at three times the fundamental frequency, 192 times per second, and corresponds to G below middle C; the interval between the pitches is called the perfect fifth. The third overtone, four times the fundamental (256 vibrations per second), is two octaves above it, middle C. The fourth overtone, five times the fundamental (320 vibrations a second), is the E above middle C, separated from it by an interval called the major third. These three pitches are the heart of the pitch inventory in Western music and many other idioms. The lowest and most stable note, C in our example, is called the tonic, and most melodies tend to return to it and The Meaning of Life 531 end on it, giving the listener a sense of repose. The perfect fifth or G note is called the dominant, and melodies tend to move toward it and pause there at intermediate points in the melody. The major third or E note, in many (but not all) cases, gives a feeling of brightness, pleasantness, or joy. For example, the opening of Bill Haleys "Rock Around the Clock" begins with the tonic ("One oclock, two oclock, three oclock, rock") proceeds to the major third ("Four oclock, five oclock, six oclock, rock"), goes to the dominant ("Seven oclock, eight oclock, nine oclock, rock") and remains there for several beats before launching into the main verses, each of which ends on the tonic. More complicated pitch inventories are filled out by adding notes to the tonic and the dominant, often corresponding in pitch to the higher and higher (and softer and softer) overtones of a complex vibration. The seventh overtone of our reference note (448 vibrations a second) is close to middle A (but, for complicated reasons, not exactly at it). The ninth (576 vibrations a second) is the D in the octave above middle C. Put the five pitches together in the same octave and you get the five-tone or pentatonic scale, common in musical systems across the world. (At least, this is a popular explanation of where musical scales come from; not everyone agrees.) Add the pitches of the next two distinct overtones (F and B) and you get the seven-tone or diatonic scale that forms the core of all Western music, from Mozart to folk songs to punk rock to most jazz. With additional overtones you get the chromatic scale, all the white and black keys on the piano. Even the esoteric art music of the twentieth century, incomprehensible to the uninitiated, tends to stick to the notes of the chromatic scale rather than using arbitrary collections of frequencies. Added to the feeling that most notes "want" to return to the tonic (C) are other tensions among the notes. For example, in many musical contexts B wants to go up to C, F wants to be pulled toward E, and A wants to go to G. Pitch inventories may also contain notes that add an emotional coloring. In the C major scale, if the E is lowered in pitch by half a tone to', 'the second below middle '),

Try it: Most people choose either the D card or the D card and the 3 card. The correct answer is D and 7. "P implies Q" is false only if P is true and Q is false. The 3 card is irrelevant; the rule said that Ds have 3s, not that 3s have Ds. The 7 card is crucial; if it had a D on the other side, the rule would be dead. Only about five to ten percent of the people who are given the test select the right cards. Even people who have taken logic courses get it wrong. (Incidentally, its not that people interpret "If D then 3" as "If D then 3 and vice versa." If they did interpret it that way but otherwise behaved like logicians, they would turn overall four cards.) Dire implications were seen. John Q. Public was irrational, unscientific, prone to confirming his prejudices rather than seeking evidence that could falsify them. But when the arid numbers and letters are replaced with real-world events, sometimes though only sometimes people turn into logicians. You are a bouncer in a bar, and are enforcing the rule "If a person is drinking beer, he must be eighteen or older." You may check what people are drinking or how old they are. Which do you have to check: a beer drinker, a Coke drinker, a twenty-five-year-old, a sixteen-year-old? Most people correctly select the beer drinker and the sixteen-year-old. But mere concreteness is not enough. The rule "If a person eats hot chili peppers, then he drinks cold beer" is no easier to falsify than the Ds and 3s. Leda Cosmides discovered that people get the answer right when the Good Ideas 337 rule is a contract, an exchange of benefits. In those circumstances, showing that the rule is false is equivalent to finding cheaters. A contract is an implication of the form "If you take a benefit, you must meet a requirement"; cheaters take the benefit without meeting the requirement. Beer in a bar is a benefit that one earns by proof of maturity, and cheaters are underage drinkers. Beer after chili peppers is mere cause and effect, so Coke drinking (which logically must be checked) doesnt seem relevant. Cosmides showed that people do the logical thing whenever they construe the Ps and Qs as benefits and costs, even when the events are exotic, like eating duiker meat and finding ostrich eggshells. Its not that a logic module is being switched on, but that people are using a different set of rules. These rules, appropriate to detecting cheaters, sometimes coincide with logical rules and sometimes dont. When the cost and benefit terms are flipped, as in "If a person pays $20, he receives a watch," people still choose the cheater card (he receives the watch, he doesnt pay $20) a choice that is neither logically correct nor the typical error made with meaningless cards. In fact, the very same story can draw out logical or nonlogical choices depending on the readers interpretation of who, if anyone, is a cheater. "If an employee gets a pension, he has worked for ten years. Who is violating the rule?" If people take the employees point of view, they seek the twelve-year workers without pensions; if they take the employers point of view, they seek the eight-year workers who hold them.

Worse, the eyes flit from spot to spot several times a second, and outside the crosshairs of the fovea the view is surprisingly coarse. (Hold your hand a few inches from your line of sight; it is impossible to count the fingers.) I am not just reviewing the anatomy of the eyeball. One could imagine the brain assembling a collage out of the snapshots taken at each glimpse, like the panoramic cameras that expose a frame of film, pan a precise amount, expose the adjacent stretch of film, and so on, yielding a seamless wideangle picture. But the brain is not a panoramic camera. Laboratory studies have shown that when people move their eyes or head, they immediately lose the graphic details of what they were looking at. Second, we dont have x-ray vision. We see surfaces, not volumes. If you watch me put an object inside a box or behind a tree, you know its there but dont see it there and cannot report its details. Once again, this 258 J is not just a reminder that you are not Superman. We mortals could have been equipped with a photographic memory that updates a 3-D model by pasting in information from previous views wherever it belongs. But we were not so equipped. When it comes to rich visual detail, out of sight is out of mind. Third, we see in perspective. When you stand between railroad tracks, they seem to converge toward the horizon. Of course you know they do not really converge; if they did, the train would derail. But its impossible not to see them as converging, even though your sense of depth provides plenty of information that your brain could use to cancel the effect. We also are aware that moving objects loom, shrink, and foreshorten. In a genuine scale model, none of this can happen. To be sure, the visual system eliminates perspective to a certain degree. People other than artists have trouble seeing that the near corner of a desk projects an acute angle and the far corner an obtuse angle; both look like the right angles they are in reality. But the railroad tracks show that perspective is not completely eliminated. Fourth, in a strict geometric sense we see in two dimensions, not three. The mathematician Henri Poincare came up with an easy way to determine the number of dimensions of some entity. Find an object that can divide the entity into two pieces, then count the dimensions of the divider and add one. A point cannot be divided at all; therefore, it has zero dimensions. A line has one dimension, because it can be severed by a point. A plane has two dimensions, because it can be rent by a line, though not by a point. A sphere has three, because nothing less than a two-dimensional blade can cleave it; a pellet or a needle leaves it whole. What about the visual field? It can be sundered by a line. The horizon, for example, divides the visual field in two. When we stand in front of a taut cable, everything we see is on one side or the other. The perimeter of a round table also partitions the visual field: every point is either within it or outside. Add one to the one-dimensionality of a line, and you get two. By this criterion, the visual field is two-dimensional. Incidentally, this does not mean that the visual field is flat. Two-dimensional', 'there is a bookshelf '),
(169, 47, 2, 'there is seldom any mystery in why we seek the goals we seek why, for example, people would rather make love with an attractive partner than get a slap on the belly with a wet fish. The things that become objects of desire are the kinds of things that led, on average, to enhanced odds of survival and reproduction in the environment in which we evolved: water, food, safety, sex, status, mastery over the environment, and the well-being of children, friends, and kin. The fourth feature of consciousness is the funneling of control to an executive process: something we experience as the self, the will, the "I." The self has been under assault lately. The mind is a society of agents, according to the artificial intelligence pioneer Marvin Minsky. Its a large 144 J collection of partly finished drafts, says Daniel Dennett, who adds, "Its a mistake to look for the President in the Oval Office of the brain." The society of mind is a wonderful metaphor, and I will use it with gusto when explaining the emotions. But the theory can be taken too far if it outlaws any system in the brain charged with giving the reiris or the floor to one of the agents at a time. The agents of the brain might very well be organized hierarchically into nested subroutines with a set of master decision rules, a computational demon or agent or good-kind-ofhomunculus, sitting at the top of the chain of command. It would not be a ghost in the machine, just another set of if-then rules or a neural network that shunts control to the loudest, fastest, or strongest agent one level down. We even have hints about the brain structures that house the decision- making circuitry. The neurologist Antonio Damasio has noted that damage to the anterior cingulate sulcus, which receives input from many higher perceptual areas and is connected to the higher levels of the motor system, leaves a patient in a seemingly alert but strangely unresponsive state. The report led Francis Crick to proclaim, only partly in jest, that the seat of the will had been discovered. And for many decades neurologists have known that exercising the will forming and carrying out plans- is a job of the frontal lobes. A sad but typical example came to me from a man who called about his fifteen-year-old son, who had suffered an injury to his frontal lobes in a car accident. The boy would stay in the shower for hours at a time, unable to decide when to get out, and could not leave the house because he kept looping back to his room to check whether he had turned off the lights. Why would a society of mental agents need an executive at the top? The reason is as clear as the old Yiddish expression "You cant dance at two weddings with only one tuches." No matter how many agents we have in our minds, we each have exactly one body. Custody of each major part must be granted to a controller that selects a plan from the hubbub of competing agents. The eyes have to point at one object at a time; they cant fixate on the empty space halfway between two interesting objects or wobble between them in a tug-of-war. The limbs must be choreographed to pull the body or objects along a path that attains the goal of just one of the minds agents.

(170, 48, 2, 'third dimension It would be natural to use the fruits of their labors to build a three-dimensional representation of the world. The retinal mosaic in which the scene is depicted gives way to a mental sandbox in which it is sculpted; the picture becomes a scale model. A 3- D model would correspond to our ultimate understanding of the world. When a child looms up to us and then shrinks away, we know we are not in Wonderland, where one pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small. And unlike the proverbial (and apocryphal) ostrich, w& do not think that objects vanish when we look away or cover them up. We negotiate reality because our thought and action are guided by knowledge of a large, stable, solid world. Perhaps vision gives us that knowledge in the form of a scale model. There is nothing inherently fishy about the scale-model theory. Many computer-aided design programs use software models of solid objects, and CAT-scan and MRI machines use sophisticated algorithms to assemble them. A 3-D model might have a list of the millions of coordinates of the tiny cubes that make up a solid object, called volume elements or "voxels" by analogy to the picture elements or "pixels" making up a picture. Each coordinate-triplet is paired with a piece of information, such as the density of the tissue at that spot in the body. Of course, if the brain stored voxels, they would not have to be arranged in a 3-D cube in the head, any more than voxels are arranged in a 3-D cube inside a computer. All that matters is that each voxel have a consistent set of neurons dedicated to it, so the patterns of firing can register the contents of the voxel. The Minds Eye 257 But now is the time to be vigilant about the homunculus. There is no problem with the idea that some software demon or look-up algorithm or neural network accesses information from a scale model, as long as we are clear that it accesses the information directly: coordinates of a voxel in, contents of the voxel out. Just dont think about the look-up algorithm seeing the scale model. Its pitch black in there, and the looker-upper doesnt have a lens or a retina or even a vantage point; it is anywhere and everywhere. There is no projection, no perspective, no field of view, no occlusion. Indeed, the whole point of the scale model is to eliminate these nuisances. If you want to think of a homunculus at all, imagine exploring a room-sized scale model of a city in the dark. You can wander through it, coming at a building from any direction, palpating its exterior or sticking fingers through windows and doors to probe its insides. When you grasp a building, its sides are always parallel, whether you are at arms length or up close. Or think about feeling the shape of a small toy in your hands, or a candy in your mouth. But vision even the 3-D, illusion-free vision that the brain works so hard to achieve is nothing like that! At best, we have an abstract appreciation of the stable structure of the world around us; the immediate, resplendent sense of color and form that fills our awareness when our eyes are open is completely different. First, vision is not a theater in the round. We vividly experience only what is in front of our eyes; the world beyond the perimeter of the visual field and behind the head is known only in a vague, almost intellectual way.

The answers are to be found in any bookstore or video shop. The cliche that life imitates art is true because the function of some kinds of art is for life to imitate it. 544 Can anything be said about the psychology of good art? The philosopher Nelson Goodman came up with an insight while examining the difference between art and other symbols. Suppose by coincidence an electrocardiogram and a Hokusai drawing of Mount Fuji both consisted of the same jagged line. Both tracings stand for something, but the only part of the electrocardiogram that matters is the position of each point that the line passes through. Its color and thickness, the size of the tracing, and the color and shading of the paper are irrelevant. If they were changed, the diagram would remain the same. But in the Hokusai drawing, none of the features may be ignored or casually altered; any might have been deliberately crafted by the artist. Goodman calls this property of art "repleteness." A good artist takes advantage of repleteness and puts every aspect of the medium to good use. She might as well do so. She already has the eye and ear of the audience, and the work, having no practical function, does not have to meet any demanding mechanical specifications; every part is up for grabs. Heathcliff has to show his passion and fury somewhere; why not against the stormy, spooky Yorkshire moors?

That same trust would have made me submit to medical quackery a century ago and to a witch doctors charms millennia ago.

And beliefs about a world of spirits do not come from nowhere. They are hypotheses intended to explain certain data that stymie our everyday theories. Edward Tylor, an early anthropologist, noted that animistic beliefs are grounded in universal experiences. When people dream, their body stays in bed but some other part of them is up and about in the world. The soul and the body also part company in the trance brought on by an illness or a hallucinogen. Even when we are awake, we see shadows and reflections in still water that seem to carry the essence of a person without having mass, volume, or continuity in time and space. And in death the body has lost some invisible force that animates it in life. One theory that brings these facts together is that the soul wanders off when we sleep, lurks in the shadows, looks back at us from the surface of a pond, and leaves the body when we die. Modern science has come up 558 J with a better theory of shadows and reflections. But how well does it do at explaining the sentient self that dreams, imagines, and directs the body? Some problems continue to baffle the modern mind. As the philosopher Colin McGinn put it in his summary of them, "The head spins in theoretical disarray; no explanatory model suggests itself; bizarre ontologies loom. There is a feeling of intense confusion, but no clear idea about where the confusion lies." I discussed one of the problems in Chapter 2: consciousness in the sense of sentience or subjective experience (not in the sense of information access or self-reflection). How could an event of neural informationprocessing cause the feel of a toothache or the taste of lemon or the color purple?

When Chagnon mentioned the meat-shortage hypothesis to his Yanomamo informants, they laughed incredulously and said, "Even though we like meat, we like women a whole lot more." Chagnon points out that they are not so different from us. "Some Saturday night just visit a hard-hat bar where fights are frequent. What are the fights usually about?

Like stereo vision, these experts work to give us an accurate grasp of the worlds surfaces, but they run on different kinds of information, solve different kinds of problems, and make different kinds of assumptions about the world. The first problem is perspective: a 3-D object gets projected into a 2-D shape on the retina. Unfortunately, any projection could have come from an infinite number of objects, so there is no way to recover a shape from its projection alone (as Ames reminded his viewers), "So," evolution seems to have said, "no ones perfect." Our shape analyzer plays the odds and makes us see the most probable state of the world, given the retinal image. How can a visual system calculate the most probable state of the world from the evidence on the retina? Probability theory offers a simple answer: Bayes theorem, the most straightforward way of assigning a probability to a hypothesis based on some evidence. Bayes theorem says that the odds favoring one hypothesis over another can be calculated from just two numbers for each hypothesis. One is the prior probability: how confident are you in the hypothesis before you even look at the evidence? The other is the likelihood: if the hypothesis were true, what is the probability that the evidence as you are seeing it now would have appeared? Multiply the prior probability of Hypothesis 1 by the likelihood of the evidence under Hypothesis 1. Multiply the prior probability of Hypothesis 2 by the likelihood of the evidence under Hypothesis 2. Take the ratio of the two numbers. You now have the odds in favor of the first hypothesis. 1 low does our 3-D line analyzer use Bayes theorem? It puts its money on the object that has the greatest likelihood of producing those lines if it were really in the scene, and that has a good chance of being in scenes in general. It assumes, as Einstein once said about God, that the world is subtle but not malicious. So the shape analyzer must be equipped with some probabilities 244 about projection (how objects appear in perspective} and some probabilities about the world (what kinds of objects it has). Some of the probabilities about projection are very good indeed. A penny, theoretically, can project to a thin line, but it does so only when il is viewed edge-on. If theres a penny in the scene, what is the probability that you are viewing it edge-on? Unless someone has choreographed the two of you, not very high. The vast majority of viewpoints will make the penny project an ellipse instead. The shape analyzer assumes the current viewpoint is generic not poised with pinpoint accuracy to line things up, Ames-style and places its chips accordingly. A matchsiick, on the other hand, will project to a straight line almost all the time, so if there is a line in an image, a stick is a better guess than a disk, all else being', 'white stripe next to '),
(176, 54, 2, 'you are not identical to either of them. The blueprint that made you your set of genes is not the same as the blueprint that made them. Their genes were shuffled, randomly sampled to make sperm and eggs, and combined with each others during fertilization to create a new combination of genes and a new organism unlike them. The only things that actually replicated were the genes and fragments of genes whose copies made it into you, some of which you will in turn pass down to your children, and so on. In fact, even if your mother had cloned herself, she would not have replicated; only her genes would have. That is because any changes she underwent in her lifetime losing a finger, acquiring a Hotheads 399 tattoo, having her nose pierced were not passed on to you. The only change you could have inherited was a mutation of one of the genes in the egg that was to become you. Genes, not bodies, replicate, and that means that genes, not bodies, should be selfish. DNA, of course, has no feelings; "selfish" means "acting in ways that make ones own replication more likely." The way for a gene to do that in an animal with a brain is to wire the brain so that the animals pleasures and pains cause it to act in ways that lead to more copies of the gene. Often that means causing an animal to enjoy the states that make it survive and reproduce. A full belly is satisfying because full bellies keep animals alive and moving and reproducing, leading to more copies of the genes that build brains that make full bellies feel satisfying. By building a brain that makes eating fun, a gene helps to spread copies of itself lying in the animals gonads. The actual DNA that helps build a brain, of course, doesnt itself get passed into the egg or sperm; only the copies of the gene inside the gonads do. But here is an important twist. The genes in an animals gonads are not the only extant copies of the brain-building genes; they are merely the most convenient ones for the brain-building gene to help replicate. Any copy capable of replicating, anywhere in the world, is a legitimate target, if it can be identified and if steps can be taken to help it replicate. A gene that worked to replicate copies of itself inside some other animals gonads could do as well as a gene that worked to replicate copies of itself inside its own animals gonads. As far as the gene is concerned, a copy is a copy; which animal houses it is irrelevant. To a brain-building gene, the only thing special about that animals gonads is the certainty that copies of the gene will be found in those gonads (the certainty comes from the fact that the cells in an animals body are genetic clones). That is why the brain-building genes make animals enjoy their own well-being so much. If a gene could build a brain that could tell when copies of itself were sitting in another animals gonads, it would make the brain enjoy the other animals wellbeing, and make it act in ways that increased that other animals wellbeing. When does a copy of a gene in one animal also sit inside another? When the animals are related. In most animals there is a one-in-two chance that any gene in a parent will have a copy lying inside its offspring, because offspring get half their genes from each parent. There is also a one-in-two chance that a', 'you are not identical ');
