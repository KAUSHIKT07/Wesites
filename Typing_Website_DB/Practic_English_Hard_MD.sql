Health-related biotechnology is already a multibillion-dollar success story, and it is still far from reaching its potential; other applications are likely to beget similar successes in the coming decades. The insights, the technologies, and the infrastructure that are already emerging from the genome project, together with advances in fields such as computational and structural biology, will become our most important tools in addressing a variety of human problems and needs. The biosciences research community is now embarked on a program whose boldness, even audacity, has prompted comparisons with such visionary efforts as the Apollo space program and the Manhattan Project. That life scientists should conceive such an ambitious project is not remarkable; what is surprising -- at least at first blush -- is that the project should trace its roots to the Department of Energy. For close to a half-century, the DOE and its governmental predecessors have been charged with pursuing a deeper understanding of the potential health risks posed by energy use and by energy-production technologies -- with special interest focused on the effects of radiation on humans. Indeed, it is fair to say that most of what we know today about radiological health hazards stems from studies supported by these government agencies. Among these investigations are long-standing studies of the survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as any number of experimental studies using animals, cells in culture, and nonliving systems. Much has been learned, especially about the consequences of exposure to high doses of radiation. On the other hand, many questions remain unanswered; in particular, we have much to learn about how low doses produce their insidious effects. When present merely in low but significant amounts, toxic agents such as radiation or mutagenic chemicals wreak havoc in the most subtle ways, altering the genetic instructions in our cells only slightly. The consequences can be heritable mutations too slight to produce discernible effects in a generation or two but, in their persistence and irreversibility, deeply troublesome nonetheless. Until recently, science offered little hope for detecting these tiny changes to the DNA that encodes our genetic program until they were well entrenched in the code. Needed was a tool that could detect a change in one base pair among, perhaps, as many as a hundred million. Then, in 1984, at a meeting convened jointly by the DOE and the International Commission for Protection Against Environmental Mutagens and Carcinogens, the question was first seriously asked: Can we, and should we, sequence the human genome? That is, can we develop the technology to obtain a word-by-word copy of the entire genetic script for an "average" human being, and thus to establish a benchmark for detecting the elusive mutagenic effects of radiation and cancer-causing toxins? Answering such a question was not simple. Workshops were convened in 1985 and 1986; the issue was studied by a DOE advisory group, by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, and by the National Academy of Sciences; and the matter was debated publicly and privately among biologists themselves. In the end, however, a consensus emerged that we should make a start. As in most cases of great and valuable inventions in science and art, the English lay claim to the honor of having first discovered photogenic drawing. But we shall see in the progress of our discussion here, like many other assumptions of their authors, that claim is unfounded, and they are due no more credit than for the invention of the steamboat or the cotton gin.

Besides which, the patronage of ladies improves the character of the assemblages and helps to preserve the order without which first-class patronage cannot be obtained. To adapt, companies have to speed up their strategy processes, but in so doing, large companies in rapidly changing environments face major challenges. These challenges mainly have to do with size, in particular the distance between the top of the organization and the front-line, as well as the many different industry segments and initiatives present in large companies. This "Perspectives for Managers" describes the challenges and suggests a pattern in the way certain successful, large, fast-moving companies are dealing with them, as well as certain advantages they have over smaller companies. The first challenge for large companies is to produce the bottom-up experimentation needed for adapting to a fast moving environment. It is well known that the mindset, politics, culture and systems that supported past success are a heavy legacy in large companies. Unless radically modified, this legacy quickly suffocates new rule-breaking initiatives. The literature on innovation points to the importance of creating a culture that tolerates honest failure, the open exchange of business ideas, the rotation of talent through project teams, and multi-channel access to resources. Not only is this difficult to put in place, but it is often not enough to produce a rapid flow of initiatives in the face of a conservative mainstream culture. The second challenge is the distance between the top and the front-line in large companies. Getting feedback into strategic thinking at the top from front-line experimentation, customers and suppliers is no easy matter, nor is the communication of the strategic roadmap to the front-line and the shaping of incentives and support systems. All of this is complicated in global companies by language and differences in national culture. The time lag between a change in direction at the top and its full comprehension throughout the company makes it impossible to shift direction rapidly and frequently without disorienting people. This is part of a third challenge, the difficulty of reorganizing rapidly to exploit new opportunities. Large companies are commonly organized around business units with bottom line responsibility. The push for, and the rewards based on, business unit performance result in competing business "silos", between which there is little cooperation. Reorganization usually involves shifting the focus of bottom line responsibility to a dimension that cuts across the original organizational "silos". The resistance in the old "silos" to managing in the new dimension, plus the communication difficulties already mentioned, make rapid reorganization in large companies very difficult. A fourth challenge is to achieve focus amid a multiplicity of competing initiatives that emerge once the organization is energized. Large companies have a larger portfolio of businesses, plus the resources to support many more initiatives than smaller companies. In addition, there are more top managers, each with their own favorite projects. This often results in an overload of change and growth initiatives, causing confusion at the front-line. On top of this, the politics between senior managers from different businesses with different perspectives delay critical choices and further aggravate the lack of focus.

The ASB interviews each person and assigns him or her a rating based on: experience and potential, motivation, ability to function as a member of a team, communication skills, and adaptability. Applicants who have impeccable school records and plenty of outside experience but who do not possess the required interpersonal skills for the position, may be rejected solely on that basis. Being an astronaut really means being part of a team. A significant number of applicants do not meet medical standards, and still others withdraw after gaining a complete understanding of the very demanding job. Based on the information collected during this investigation, ASB will choose its final candidates and pass that recommendation on to the NASA Administrator; he or she will make the final choices. Once selected, candidates begin a rigorous training program. As with any other career, being an astronaut has drawbacks. One commonly shared among astronauts is the intense workload and the lack of time for their families. "With this job you could work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and still not get everything done. You have to strike a balance--that is the key," says Reightler. "There can be long hours that are unpredictable. Travel is involved especially during the busiest times -- three months before and two months after a launch," agreed Ochoa. And if an applicant has hopes for a large salary -- say, comparable to those in the private sector -- they should look elsewhere. Astronauts begin their salary in accordance with the U.S. Government pay scale at GS-11 status (approximately $39,000) and top off at GS-14 status (approximately $78,000). Thats not a whole lot for a dangerous job. But for those who dream of going into space, the pay is one of the lesser considerations.

Credits arent really there for the audience, although they can be interesting to watch. Theyre really there so the studios and other industry personnel will know who did what on the film.

(377, 4, 8, 'Hubble Deep Field The telescope looked at the same patch of sky for 10 days straight and took long exposures. Scientists discovered a bewildering assortment of at least 1,500 galaxies at various distances and different stages of evolution. It allowed them to test theories about how those galaxies formed. Like any other mechanical device, though, Hubble needs periodic tune-ups. As a result, the observatory is maintained by a team of hundreds of scientists, engineers, and computer programmers at the Space Telescope Science Institute the Goddard Space Flight Center. The HST also has regular planned servicing missions. NASA sends astronauts up on the Space Shuttle for maintenance every three years, or sooner if required. The first major servicing mission came just after launch. Hubbles primary mirror was incorrectly shaped during manufacture, so the telescope could not focus all the light from an object to a single sharp point. Instead, it saw a fuzzy halo around objects it observed, and the images it sent to Earth were pretty much useless. Astronauts were sent up on the space shuttle Endeavour to catch the telescope, haul it into the shuttles cargo bay, and install two new devices -- similar in function to ordinary eyeglasses -- to correct the problem. The new lens system was called COSTAR (Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement), and it consisted of several small mirrors that would intercept the beam from the flawed mirror, correct for the defect, and relay the corrected beam to the scientific instruments at the focus of the mirror. When the HST was tested after the servicing mission, the images were not only vastly improved, but they were utterly astonishing, giving scientists an unprecedented new view of the universe. Now, all of the instruments placed in the HST have built-in corrective optics for the mirrors defect, and COSTAR is no longer needed. Another major mission came to correct Hubbles orbit. The HST uses six gyroscopes to point itself at stars and galaxies very accurately, and it must stay in an exact position while a picture is taken. Three of the gyroscopes must work perfectly to stabilize the satellite. Unfortunately, four of the gyroscopes broke at the same time. Hubble was put in a special "safe mode" for two months. In this mode, astronomers cant make any observations. Astronauts trained for the mission in Johnson Space Centers giant swimming pool. The water helps to recreate the feel of being in space. They wear special underwater space suits and float around a model of the telescope, practicing their mission. The mission was troubled by shuttle delays, but the astronauts finally docked with HST and replaced all six gyroscopes. They also upgraded the main computer system and covered the telescope with some new insulation to help keep it safe. Because the Hubble Space Telescope was designed for periodic servicing, the items to be replaced are easily accessible. The items range in size from a shoebox to a telephone booth. Most of these items can be removed or installed using special wrenches and power tools. Initially Hubble cost $1.5 billion to build and put into orbit, and its total budget in one year is in the range of 230 to 250 million dollars. But that money does more than simply keep Hubble operating on a daily basis. It also includes funds for scientific data analysis, as well as for the development of future hardware and its associated software. More importantly, though, it provides us with images and knowledge of the universe around us. That data is simply priceless! Abraham Lincoln is one of the United States best-known presidents.

But the DOEs early, catalytic decision deserves further comment, as the implications are more widespread -- and more controversial -- than initially believed. The project could deliver, and already has developed into, much more than the promised tool for assessing mutation rates. The information generated would contribute not only to a new understanding of human biology, but also to a host of practical applications in the biotechnology industry and in the arenas of agriculture and environmental protection. A 1987 report by a DOE advisory committee provided some examples. The committee foresaw that the project could ultimately lead to the efficient production of biomass for fuel, to improvements in the resistance of plants to environmental stress, and to the practical use of genetically engineered microbes to neutralize toxic wastes. In addition, the project could have an enormous impact on our ability to assess, individual by individual, the risk posed by environmental exposures to toxic agents. We know that genetic differences make some of us more susceptible, and others more resistant, to such agents. Far more work must be done before we understand the genetic basis of such variability, but this knowledge will directly address the DOEs long-term mission to understand the effects of low-level exposures to radiation and other energy-related agents -- especially the effects of such exposure on cancer risk. The Human Genome Project has other implications for the DOE as well. In 1994, taking advantage of new capabilities developed by the project, the DOE formulated the Microbial Genome Initiative to sequence the genomes of bacteria of likely interest in the areas of energy production and use, environmental remediation and waste reduction, and industrial processing. As a result of this initiative, we already have complete sequences for two microbes that live under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure. Structural studies are under way to learn what is unique about the proteins of these organisms -- the aim being ultimately to engineer these microbes and their enzymes for such practical purposes as waste control and environmental cleanup. (DOE-funded genetic engineering of a thermostable DNA polymerase has already produced an enzyme that has captured a large share of the several-hundred-million-dollar DNA polymerase market.) And other little-studied microbes hint at even more intriguing possibilities. For instance, Deinococcus radiodurans is a species that prospers even when exposed to huge doses of ionizing radiation. This microbe has an amazing ability to repair radiation-induced damage to its DNA, and a sequence of its genome could lead to understanding and ultimately taking practical advantage of its unusual capabilities. For example, it might be possible to insert foreign DNA into the microbes cells that allows it to digest toxic organic components found in highly radioactive waste, thus simplifying the task of further cleanup. Another approach might be to introduce metal-binding proteins onto the microbes surface that would scavenge highly radioactive isotopes out of solution. Biotechnology, fueled in part by insights reaped from the genome project, will also play a significant role in improving the use of fossil-based resources. Increased energy demands, projected over the next 50 years, require strategies to circumvent the many problems associated with todays dominant energy systems. The technology could help address these needs by upgrading the fuel value of our current energy resources and by providing new means for the bioconversion of raw materials to refined products -- not to mention offering the possibility of entirely new biomass-based energy sources.

On October 1, 1890, Congress set aside more than 1,500 square miles of reserved forest lands, and today 94.5% of the parks 1,170 square mile area is dedicated as true wilderness for all who visit to enjoy. At Muirs invitation, Theodore Roosevelt visited Yosemite to experience its splendor first-hand. By all accounts, Roosevelt was so impressed he became instrumental in the return of Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove to federal protection in 1906. In 1932, the Wawona Basin, including the Wawona Hotel and golf course, were added to the National Park to bring it to its current 1,170 square miles. The classic beauty and fascinating ecosystems of the Sierra Nevada mountain range are well represented in Yosemite National Park, where almost 95% of the park is designated wilderness. A place retaining its primeval character and influence, this wilderness area provides opportunities for solitude and unconfined types of experience. The lands within the wilderness range in elevation from 290 feet to 13,114 feet, the latter at the summit of Mt. Lyell. And with over 800 miles of trails to hike, visitors will find a spectrum of opportunities, of natural systems, and of levels of use. There are four regions within the park. The first region is Yosemite Valley. Beautiful and majestic, Yosemite Valley boasts some of the most popular trailheads in the park. These strenuous trails lead the hiker up the seemingly sheer granite walls which form the Valley. To reach the top of such spectacles as Half Dome, Yosemite Falls, Glacier Point, and El Capitan, the hiker will encounter steep terrain, switchbacks, and rapidly changing weather conditions. Spectacular views from the rim of the valley reward the hiker and quickly erase memories of any hardships suffered en route. In winter and early spring, nearly all of the trails in Yosemite Valley remain open, although some have winter routes designated. In addition to serving the hardy day-hiker, these trailheads provide access for seasoned winter enthusiasts into Yosemites snow-covered wilderness. The second region consists of Tuolumne Meadows and Tioga Road. Tuolumne Meadows is located at over 8,600 feet in elevation. From Tuolumne, numerous trails lead hikers to lakes, meadows, and beautiful river canyons. More strenuous overnight backpacking trips allow the adventurer access to the northernmost reaches of the Park, the area between Tuolumne Meadows and Yosemite Valley, or along extended wilderness routes such as the John Muir Trail or the Pacific Crest Trail. Because of its elevation, temperatures in Tuolumne average 15 to 20 degrees cooler than in Yosemite Valley itself. Snow is not uncommon as late as June or as early as September. Peaks, such as Mt. Dana and Mt. Lyell, retain snow throughout the summer and provide breathtaking views from their bases and summits. Once the Tioga Road closes for the season (generally in early November), this area is accessible only to well-experienced winter enthusiasts with snow shoes or skis. Tioga Road is a scenic 45 mile drive that covers almost 4,000 feet of elevation change. It begins at Crane Flat, travels through Tuolumne Meadows, and then climbs over Tioga Pass. The road is open to vehicles from late May or June (weather permitting) until the first major snow storm after November 1. During this 1 1/2 hour drive, visitors pass through meadows and forests, lakes, and granite domes. Day hikes from the Tioga Road are abundant. For backpackers, there are also numerous trailheads.

Yosemite National Park is located in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of central California, a setting so spectacular and awe-inspiring that John Muir, a naturalist and the Sierra Club founder, called it "a landscape ... that after all my wanderings still appears as the most beautiful I have ever beheld." Over millions of years, earthquakes, glaciers, and other forces of nature have left indelible footprints on this landscape, footprints that are still visible in the towering granite cliffs, thundering waterfalls, steep mountains, and deep alpine lakes, and they all beckon visitors to explore, climb, photograph, and experience their grandeur. Yosemites geological history has been evolving for some 500 million years, from the areas initial position on the ocean floor, to its later incarnations as gentle, rolling hills, and then the steep Sierra Nevada mountain range replete with deep river canyons. Three million years ago, the ice age brought glaciers that scraped and carved the valleys and canyons with such force that the remaining granite still shows the direction of the glacial movement. Those same glaciers created massive rock formations that present some of the most difficult and popular climbing challenges in the world for todays enthusiastic rock climbers. When the last glacier finally melted 10,000 years ago, rock debris dammed the valley and created Lake Yosemite, while tributary creeks plummeted off sheer cliffs and gave birth to the parks famed waterfalls. Sediment continued to fill the lake until it eventually formed the present valley floor. Yosemites geological evolution continues today as Mirror Lake slowly fills with sediment in much the same way as Lake Yosemite did. In 1996, the Happy Isles rockslide sent 80,000 tons of rock to the valley floor at 160 mph -- proof that powerful forces are still at work. The park has a rich organizational history, as well. The areas first residents were Native Americans, who inhabited the region perhaps as far back as 10,000 years ago. The most recent tribe was the Miwok, who called Yosemite Valley Ahwahnee, the place of the gaping mouth, and who called themselves Ahwahneechee. The discovery of gold in Californias foothills brought the first non-native settlers to the region around 1850; dazzled by the beauty and grandeur of the landscape, they quickly spread the word of its existence, and in 1855, the first tourists came to visit. About the same time, Galen Clark homesteaded to Yosemite Valley and began his crusade to protect the area. Clark so fiercely and loyally protected Yosemite until his death at age 96 that he became known as the "Guardian of Yosemite." In 1854, Abraham Lincoln signed the Yosemite Grant that set aside Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias as the first state park. In 1864, Yosemite became the first territory ever set aside by the United States Congress for public use and protection; however, it took another thirty-six years and the efforts of Muir, Theodore Roosevelt, and other influential conservationists to bring all the lands of todays National Park under federal protection.

"I may here add the singular sequel to this visit. On the succeeding day M. Daguerre paid me a visit to see the Telegraph and witness its operations. He seemed much gratified and remained with me perhaps two hours; two melancholy hours to him, as they afterwards proved; or while he was with me, his buildings, including his diorama, his studio, his laboratory, with all the beautiful pictures I had seen the day before, were consumed by fire. Fortunately for mankind, matter only was consumed, the soul and mind of the genius, and the process were still in existence." On his return home, Professor Morse waited with impatience for the revelation of M. Daguerres process, and no sooner was it published than he obtained a copy of the work containing it, and at once commenced taking Daguerreotype pictures. At first his goal was solely to furnish his studio with studies from nature; however, his experiments led him to believe that creating portraits by the process would be practical, and he was undoubtedly the first whose attempts were met with success.

The Hubble Space Telescope, also called the HST, is a telescopic observatory that orbits 600 kilometers above the Earth. It is the first scientific mission of any kind designed for routine service by astronauts. It is one of the largest and most complex satellites ever built and was deployed April 25, 1990 from the space shuttle Discovery. When Hubble was designed in the 1970s, NASA stated that its main scientific objectives were to determine: * The constitution, physical characteristics, and dynamics of celestial bodies. * The nature of processes that occur in the extreme physical conditions existing in and between astronomical objects. * The history and evolution of the universe. * Whether the laws of nature are universal in the space-time continuum. Thats a pretty tall order for a relatively small object! The Hubble Space Telescope is as large as a tractor-trailer (43.5 feet long and 14 feet in diameter) and weighs 12 tons. It looks like nothing more than a five-story tower of stacked silver canisters. But each canister houses important telescope equipment. The telescope has focusing mirrors, computers, imaging instruments, and pointing and control mechanisms. Extending from the telescope are solar panels for generating electricity and antennae for communicating with operators on the ground. Scientists can see better with Hubble than with any telescope on the ground because Hubble travels above the atmosphere. On Earth, the atmosphere makes pictures taken by visible-light telescopes look smeary – clouds, precipitation, and atmospheric temperature changes get in the way. But in the near vacuum of space, Hubble can take very clear, crisp pictures -- no clouds or atmosphere exist between it and the star or galaxy its observing.', 'was a stranger to '),
(382, 9, 8, 'A collection of lines in an image can narrow the odds even further, for example, a set of parallel or near-parallel lines is seldom an accident. Nonparallel lines in the world rarely project near-parallel lines in an image: most pairs of sticks strewn on a floor cross at moderate to sharp angles. But lines that are parallel in the world, such as the edges of a telephone pole, almost always project near-parallel lines. So if there are near-parallel lines in an image, the odds favor parallel edges in the world. There are many other rules of thumb that say what kinds of seulptings of the world can be counted on to give off various markings in an image. Little Ts, Ys, angles, arrows, crows feet, and parallel wiggles are the fingerprints of various straight edges, corners, right angles, and symmetrical shapes. Cartoonists have exploited these rules for millennia, and a wily shape analyzer can run them backwards when betting on what is in the world. But of course running a likelihood backwards saying that parallel stuff usually projects near-parallel images, therefore near-para lie I images imply parallel stuff is unsound. It is like hearing hoofbeats outside your window and concluding that they came from a zebra, because zebras often make hoofbeats. The prior probability that the world contains some entity how many zebras are out there, how many parallel edges are out there has to be multiplied in. For an odds-playing shape analyzer to work, the world had better contain lots of the straight, regular, symmetrical, compact kinds of objects that it likes to guess. Does it? A romantic might think that the natural world is organic and soft, its hard edges bulldozed in by the Army Corps of Engineers. As a literature professor recently declared to his class, "Straight lines on the landscape are put there by man." A skeptical student, Gail Jensen Sanford, pubThe Minds Eye 245 lished a list of straight lines in nature, recently reprinted in Harpers magazine: line along the top of a breaking wave; distant edge of a prairie; paths of hard rain and hail, snow-covered fields; patterns in crystals; lines of white quartz in a granite surface; icicles, stalactites, stalagmites; surface of a calm lake; markings on zebras and tigers; bill of a duck; legs of a sandpiper; angle of migrating birds; dive of a raptor; new frond of a fem; spikes of a cactus; trunks of young, fast-growing trees; pine needles; silk strands ivoven by spiders; cracks in the surface of ice; strata of metamorphic rock, sides of a volcano; wisp of windblown altocumulus clouds; inside edge of a half-moon. Some of these are arguable, and others will do a shape guesser more harm than good, (llie horizon of a lake or prairie and the edge of a halfmoon do not come from lines in the world.) But the point is right. Many laws of the world give it nice, anaiyzable shapes. Motion, tension, and gravity make straight lines. Gravity makes right angles. Cohesion makes smooth contours. Organisms that move evolve to be symmetrical. Natural selection shapes their body parts into tools, duplicating the human engineers demand for well-machined parts. Large surfaces collect patterns with roughly equal sizes, shapes, and spacing: cracks, leaves, pebbles, sand, ripples, needles. Not only are the seemingly carpentered and wallpapered parts of the world the parts most recoverable by a shape analyzer; they are the parts most worth recovering.

The innate specs include how many units there are, how they are connected, what the initial connection weights are, and how much the weights should be nudged up and down on each learning episode. Simulated Evolution gives the networks a big head start in their learning careers. So evolution can guide learning in neural networks. Surprisingly, learning can guide evolution as well. Remember Darwins discussion of "the incipient stages of useful structures" the what-good-is-half-an-eye problem. The neural-network theorists Geoffrey Hinton and Steven Nowlan invented a fiendish example. Imagine an animal controlled by a neural network with twenty connections, each either excitatory (on) or neutral (off). But the network is utterly useless unless all twenty connections are correctly set. Not only is it no good to have half a network; it is no good to have ninety-five percent of one. In a population of animals whose connections are determined by random mutation, a fitter mutant, with all the right connections, arises only about once every million (220) genetically distinct organisms. Worse, the advantage is immediately lost if the animal reproduces sexually, because after having finally found the magic combination of weights, it swaps half of them away. In simulations of this scenario, no adapted network ever evolved. But now consider a population of animals whose connections can come in three forms: innately on, innately off, or settable to on or off by learning. Mutations determine which of the three possibilities (on, off, learnable) a given connection has at the animals birth. In an avelrage animal in these simulations, about half the connections are learnable, the other half on or off. Learning works like this. Each animal, as it lives its life, tries out settings for the learnable connections at random until it hits upon the magic combination. In real life this might be figuring out how to catch prey or crack a nut; whatever it is, the animal senses its good fortune and retains those settings, ceasing the trial and error. From then on it enjoys a higher rate of reproduction. The earlier in life the animal acquires the right settings, the longer it will have to reproduce at the higher rate. Now with these evolving learners, or learning evolvers, there is an advantage to having less than one hundred percent of the correct network. Take all the animals with ten innate connections. About one in a thousand (210) will have all ten correct. (Remember that only one; in a million wowlearning animals had all twenty of its innate connections correct.) That well-endowed animal will have some probability of attaining the Revenge of the Nerds 179 completely correct network by learning the other ten connections; if it has a thousand occasions to learn, success is fairly likely. The successful animal will reproduce earlier, hence more often. And among its descendants, there are advantages to mutations that make more and more of the connections innately correct, because with more good connections to begin with, it takes less time to learn the rest, and the chances of going through life without having learned them get smaller. In Hinton and Nowlans simulations, the networks thus evolved more and more innate connections. The connections never became completely innate, however. As more and more of the connections were fixed, the selection pressure to fix the remaining ones tapered off, because with only a few connections to learn, every organism was guaranteed to learn them quickly.

That is, it has to characterize the ecological niche that humans entered. The only theory that has risen to this challenge comes from John Tooby and the anthropologist Irven DeVore. Tooby and DeVore begin by noting that species evolve at one anothers expense. We fantasiJfe about the land of milk and honey, the big rock candy mountaifffand tangerine trees with marmalade skies, but real ecosystems^reaifferent. Except for fruits (which trick hungry animals intodj«p*ersing seeds), virtually every food is the body part of some other^rganism, which would just as soon keep that part for itselfQfganisms evolve defenses against being eaten, and would-be dipei*5evolve weapons to overcome these defenses, prodding the woHra-be meals to evolve better defenses, and so on, in an evolutionajjf* arms race. These weapons and defenses are genetically based an£r*relatively fixed within the lifetime of the individual; therefore they xhange slowly. The balance between eater and eaten develops only over evolutionary time. Humans, Tooby and DeVore suggest, entered the "cognitive niche." Remember the definition of intelligence from Chapter 2: using knowledge of how things work to attain goals in the face of obstacles. By learning which manipulations achieve which goals, humans have mastered the art of the surprise attack. They use novel, goal-oriented courses of action to overcome the Maginot Line defenses of other organisms, which can respond only over evolutionary time. The manipulations can be novel because human knowledge is not just couched in concrete instructions like "how to catch a rabbit." Humans analyze the world using intuitive theories of objects, forces, paths, places, manners, states, substances, hidden biochemical essences, and, for other animals and people, beliefs and desires. (These intuitive theories are the topic of Chapter 5.) People compose new knowledge and plans by mentally playing out combinatorial interactions among these laws in their minds eye. Many theorists have wondered what illiterate foragers do with their capacity for abstract intelligence. The foragers would have! better grounds for asking the question about modern couch potatoes. Life for foragers (including our ancestors) is a camping trip that never ends, but without the space blankets, Swiss Army knives, and freeze-dried pasta al pesto. Living by their wits, human groups develop sophisticated techRevenge of the Nerds 189 nologies and bodies of folk science. All human cultures ever documented have words for the elements of space, time, motion, speed, mental states, tools, flora, fauna, and weather, and logical connectives (not, and, same, opposite, part-whole, and general-particular). They combine the words into grammatical sentences and use the underlying propositions to reason about invisible entities like diseases, meteorological forces, and absent animals. Mental maps represent the locations of thousands of noteworthy sites, and mental calendars represent nested cycles of weather, animal migrations, and the life histories of plants.

(385, 12, 8, 'A psychologist colleague of mine once thought that bees offered a good pedagogical opportunity to convey the sophistication of neural computation to our undergraduates. He devoted the first week of his entry-level course in cognitive science to some of the ingenious experiments. The next year the lectures spilled over to the second week, then the third, and so on, until the students complained that the course had become an Introduction to Bee Cognition. There are dozens of comparable examples. Many species compute how much time to forage at each patch so as to optimize their rate of return of calories per energy expended in foraging. Some birds learn the emphemeris function, the path of the sun above the horizon over the course of the day and the year, necessary for navigating by the sun. The barn owl uses sub-millisecond discrepancies between the arrival times of a sound at its two ears to swoop down on a rustling mouse in pitch blackness. Cacheing species place nuts and seeds in unpredictable hiding places to foil thieves, but months later must recall them all. I mentioned in the preceding chapter that the Clarks Nutcracker can remember ten thousand hiding places. Even Pavlovian and operant conditioning, the textbook cases of learning by association, turn out to be not a general stickiness of coinciding stimuli and responses in the brain, but complex algorithms for multivariate, nonstationary time series analysis (predicting when events will occur, based on their history of occurrences). The moral of this animal show is that animals brains are just as specialized and well engineered as their bodies. A brain is a precision instrument that allows a creature to use information to solve the problems presented by its lifestyle. Since organisms lifestyles differ, and since they are related to one another in a great bush, not a great chain, species cannot be ranked in IQ or by the percentage of human intelligence they have achieved. Whatever is special about the humsln mind cannot be just more, or better, or more flexible animal intelligence, because there is no such thing as generic animal intelligence. Each animal has evolved information-processing machinery to solve its problems, and we evolved machinery to solve ours. The sophisticated algorithms found in even the tiniest dabs of nervous tissue serve as yet another eye-opener joining the difficulty of building a robot, the circumscribed effects of brain damage, and the similarities betweein twins Revenge of the Nerds 183 reared apart for the hidden complexity we should expect to find in the human mind. "[ he hrains of mammals, like the hodies of mammals, follow a common general plan. Many of the same cell types, chemicals, tissues, suborgans, way-stations, and pathways are found throughout the class, and the major visible differences come from inflating or shrinking the parts. But under the microscope, differences appear. The number of cortical areas differs widely, from twenty or fewer in rats to fifty or more in humans. Primates differ Irom other mammals in the number of visual areas, their interconnections, and their hookup to the motor and decision regions of the frontal lobes. When a species has a noteworthy talent, it is reflected in the gross anatomy of its brain, sometimes in ways visible to the naked eve. The takeover of monkeys brains by visual areas (about one-half the territory) reflects more accurately, allows their aptitude for depth, color, motion, and visually guided grasping. Rats that relv on sonar have additional brain areas dedicated to their ultrasonic hearing, and desert mice that cache seeds arc born with a bigger hippocampus a seat of the cognitive map than closely related species', 'A psychologist colleague of '),
(386, 13, 8, 'a species also does not call for a conservative political agenda, as journalists and social scientists often fear. Some worry that if our motives put us into conflict with others, exploitation and violence would be morally correct; since they are deplorable, conflict had better not be part of our nature. The reasoning, of course, is fallacious: nothing says that nature has to be nice, and what people want to do is not necessarily what they ought to do. Others worry that if conflicting motives are inevitable, it would be futile to try to reduce violence and exploitation; our current social arrangements would be the best one can hope for. But that does not follow either. Among modern Western societies, homicide rates vary from 0.5 per million persons per year in Iceland in the first half of the twentieth century, to 10 in most European countries at present, to 25 in Canada, to 100 in the United States and Brazil. There is plenty of room for practical measures that could reduce the murder rate before we are faced with the academic question of whether it can ever be reduced to zero. Moreover, there are ways to reduce conflict other than to dream of a golden future of indiscriminate love. People in all societies not only perpetrate violence but Family Values 429 deplore it. And people everywhere take steps to reduce violent conflict, such as sanctions, redress, censure, mediation, ostracism, and law. I hope this discussion strikes you as trite, so 1 can get on with the content of the chapter. My goal is not to convince you that people dont always want the best for one another, but to try to explain when and why that should be true. But sometimes the trite has to be stated. The observation that conflict is part of the human condition, banal though it is, contradicts fashionable beliefs. One is expressed in the gluey metaphor of social relations as attachment, bonding, and cohesion. Another is the assumption that we unthinkingly play out the roles society assigns to us, and that social reform is a matter of rewriting the roles. I suspect that if you pressed many academics and social critics you would find views no less Utopian than those of Charles Reich. If the mind is an organ of computation engineered by natural selection, our social motives should be strategies that are tailored to the tournaments we play in. People should have distinct kinds of thoughts and feelings about kin and non-kin, and about parents, children, siblings, dates, spouses, acquaintances, friends, rivals, allies, and enemies. Lets explore them in turn. KITH AND KIN Smile on your brother, sang the Youngbloods; a brotherhood of man, sang John Lennon. When we talk of beneficence, we use the language of kinship. Our father who art in heaven; the fatherhood of God; church fathers; Father Christmas; father figure; patriotism. The mother country; the mother church; Mother Superior; motherhood and apple pie; maternal. Blood brothers; black brothers; brothers-in-arms; brotherly love; temple brotherhoods; brethren; fraternities; Brother, can you spare a dime? Sisterhood is powerful; sister cities; soul sisters; sisters of mercy; sororities. The family of man; crime families; one big happy family. The kinship metaphors have a simple message: treat certain people as kindly as you treat your blood relatives. We all understand the presupposition. The love of kin comes naturally; the love of non-kin does not. That is the fundamental fact of the social world, steering everything from how we grow up to the rise and fall of empires and religions. The explanation is straightforward. Relatives share genes to a', 'a species also does '),

If you cant state the function more economically than you can describe the structure, you dont have design. A lens is different from a diaphragm, which in turn is different from a photopigment, and no unguided physical process would deposit the three in the same object, let alone align them perfectly. But they do have something in common all are needed for high-fidelity image formation and that makes sense of why they are found together in an eye. For the flerning rock, in contrast, describing the structure and stating the function are one and the same. The notion of function adds nothing. 174 And most important, attributing adaptive complexity to natural selection is not just a recognition of design excellence, like the expensive appliances in the Museum of Modern Art. Natural selection is a falsifiable hypothesis about the origin of design and imposes onerous empirical requirements. Remember how it works: from competition among replicators. Anything that showed signs of design but did not come from a long line of replicators could not be explained by in fact, would refute the theory of natural selection: natural species that lacked reproductive organs, insects growing like crystals out of rocks, television sets on the moon, eyes spewing out of vents on the ocean floor, caves shaped like hotel rooms down to the details of hangers and ice buckets. Moreover, the beneficial functions all have to be in the ultimate service of reproduction. An organ can be designed for sieeing or eating or mating or nursing, but it had better not be designed for the beauty of nature, the harmony of the ecosystem, or instant self-destruction. Finally, the beneficiary of the function has to be the replicator. Darwin pointed out that if horses had evolved saddles, his theory would immediately be falsified. Rumors and folklore notwithstanding, natural selection remains the heart of explanation in biology. Organisms can be understood only as interactions among adaptations, by-products of adaptations, and noise. The by-products and noise dont rule out the adaptations, nor do they leave us staring blankly, unable to tell them apart. It is exactly what makes organisms so fascinating their improbable adaptive design that calls for reverse-engineering them in the light of natural selection. The by-products and noise, because they are defined negatively as un-adaptations, also can be discovered only via reverse-engineering. This is no less true for human intelligence. The major faculties of the mind, with their feats no robot can duplicate, show the handiwork of selection. That does not mean that every aspect of the mind is adaptive. From low-level features like the sluggishness and noisiness of neurons, to momentous activities like art, music, religion, and dreams, we should expect to find activities of the mind that are not adaptations in the biologists sense. But it does mean that our understanding of how the mind works will be woefully incomplete or downright wrong unless it meshes with our understanding of how the mind evolved. That is the topic of the rest of the chapter. Revenge of the Nerds 175 THE BLIND PROGRAMMER Why did brains evolve to start with? The answer lies in the value of information, which brains have been designed to process. Every time you buy a newspaper, you are paying for information. Economic theorists have explained why you should: information confers a benefit that is worth paying for. Life is a choice among gambles.

The most dramatic change in the archeological record, the Upper Paleolithic transition also called the Great Leap Forward and the Human Revolution had to wait another 50,000 years. Therefore, it is said, the human revolution must have been a cultural change. Calling it a revolution is no exaggeration. All other hominids come out of the comic strip B.C., but the Upper Paleolithic people were the Flintstones. More than 45,000 years ago they somehow crossed sixty miles of open ocean to reach Australia, where they left behind hearths, cave paintings, the worlds first polished tools, and todays aborigines. Europe (home of the Cro-Magnons) and the Middle East also saw unprecedented arts and technologies, which used new materials like antler, ivory, and bone as well as stone, sometimes transported hundreds of miles. The toolkit included fine blades, needles, awls, many kinds of axes and scrapers, spear points, spear throwers, bows and arrows, fishhooks, engravers, flutes, maybe even calendars. They built shelters, and they slaughtered large animals by the thousands. They decorated everything in sight tools, cave walls, their bodies and carved knick-knacks in the shapes of animals and naked women, which archeologists euphemistically call "fertility symbols." They were us. Ways of life certainly can shoot off without any biological change, as in the more recent agricultural, industrial, and information revolutions. That is especially true when populations grow to a point where the Revenge of the Nerds 203 insights of thousands of inventors can be pooled. But the first human revolution was not a cascade of changes set off by a few key inventions. Ingenuity itself was the invention, manifested in hundreds of innovations tens of thousands of miles and years apart. I find it hard to believe that the people of 100,000 years ago had the same minds as those of the Upper Paleolithic revolutionaries to come indeed, the same minds as ours and sat around for 50,000 years without it dawning on a single one of them that you could carve a tool out of bone, or without a single one feeling the urge to make anything look pretty. And there is no need to believe it the 50,000-year gap is an illusion. First, the so-called anatomically modern humans of 100,000 years ago may have been more modern than their Neanderthal contemporaries, but no one would mistake them for contemporary humans. They had brow ridges, protruding facesv and heavily built skeletons outside the contemporary range. Their bodies had to evolve to become us, and their brains surely did as well. The myth that they are completely modern grew out of the habit of treating species labels as if they were real entities. When applied to evolving organisms, they are no more than a convenience. No one wants to invent a new species every time a tooth is found, so intermediate forms tend to get shoehorned into the nearest available category. The reality is that hominids must always have come in dozens or hundreds of variants, scattered across a large network of occasionally interacting subpopulations. The tiny fraction of individuals immortalized as fossils at any point were not necessarily our direct ancestors. The "anatomically modern" fossils are closer to us than to anyone else, but either they had more evolving to do or they were away from the hotbed of change. Second, the revolution probably began well before the commonly cited watershed of 40,000 years ago. Thats when fancy artifacts begin to appear in European caves, but Europe has always attracted more attention than it deserves, because it has lots of caves and lots of archeologists. France alone has three hundred well-excavated', 'and lifestyle as their '),
(389, 16, 8, 'and many social psychologists have concluded that the mind is not designed to grasp the laws of probability, even though the laws rule the universe. The brain can process limited amounts of information, so instead of computing theorems it uses crude Good Ideas 345 rules of thumb. One rule is: the more memorable an event, the more likely it is to happen. (I can remember a recent gory plane crash, therefore planes are unsafe.) Another is: the more an individual resembles a stereotype, the more likely he is to belong to that category. (Linda fits my image of a feminist bankteller better than she fits my image of a bankteller, so shes more likely to be a feminist bankteller.) Popular books with lurid titles have spread the bad news: Irrationality: The Enemy Within; Inevitable Illusions: How Mistakes of Reason Rule Our Minds; How We Know What Isnt So: The Fallibility of Human Reason in Everyday Life. The sad history of human folly and prejudice is explained by our ineptness as intuitive statisticians. Tversky and Kahnemans demonstrations are among the most thought-provoking in psychology, and the research has drawn attention to the depressingly low intellectual quality of our public discourse about societal and personal risk. But in a probabilistic world, could the human mind really be oblivious to probability? The solutions to the problems that people flub can be computed with a few keystrokes on a cheap calculator. Many animals, even bees, compute accurate probabilities as they forage. Could those computations really exceed the information-processing capacity of the trillion-synapse human brain? It is hard to believe, and one does not have to believe it. Peoples reasoning is not as stupid as it might first appear. To begin with, many risky choices are just that, choices, and cannot be gainsaid. Take the gamblers, plane phobics, and chemical avoiders. Are they really irrational} Some people take pleasure in awaiting the outcomes of events that could radically improve their lives. Some people dislike being strapped in a tube and flooded with reminders of a terrifying way to die. Some people dislike eating foods deliberately laced with poison (just as some people might choose not to eat a hamburger fortified with harmless worm meat). There is nothing irrational in any of these choices, any more than in preferring vanilla over chocolate ice cream. The psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer, along with Cosmides and Tooby, have noted that even when peoples judgments of probability depart from the truth, their reasoning may not be illogical. No mental faculty is omniscient. Color vision is fooled by sodium vapor streetlights, but that does not mean it is badly designed. It is demonstrably well designed, far better than any camera at registering constant colors with changing illumination (see Chapter 4). But it owes its success at this unsolvable problem 346 J to tacit assumptions about the world. When the assumptions are violated in an artificial world, color vision fails. The same may be true of our probability-estimators. Take the notorious "gamblers fallacy": expecting that a run of heads increases the chance of a tail, as if the coin had a memory and a desire to be fair. I remember to my shame an incident during a family vacation when I was a teenager. My father mentioned that we had suffered through several days of rain and were due for good weather, and I corrected him, accusing him of the gamblers fallacy. But long-suffering Dad was right, and his know-it-all son was wrong. Cold fronts arent raked off the earth at days end and replaced with new ones the next morning.

(390, 17, 8, 'and so on Each detector must trigger an emotion demon that sets up the appropriate goal continuing to reciprocate, breaking off the relationship, and so on. Here is how Trivers reverse-engineered the moralistic emotions as strategies in the reciprocity game. (His assumptions about the causes and consequences of each emotion are well supported by the literature in experimental social psychology and by studies of other cultures, though they are hardly necessary, as real-life examples no doubt will flood into mind.) Liking is the emotion that initiates and maintains an altruistic partnership. It is, roughly, a willingness to offer someone a favor, and is directed to those who appear willing to offer favors back. We like people who are nice to us, and we are nice to people whom we like. Anger protects a person whose niceness has left her vulnerable to being cheated. When the exploitation is discovered, the person classifies the offending act as unjust and experiences indignation and a desire to respond with moralistic aggression: punishing the cheater by severing the relationship and sometimes by hurting him. Many psychologists have remarked that anger has moral overtones; almost all anger is righteous anger. Furious people feel they are aggrieved and must redress an injustice. Gratitude calibrates the desire to reciprocate according to the costs and benefits of the original act. We are grateful to people when their favor helps us a lot and has cost them a lot. Sympathy, the desire to help those in need, may be an emotion for earning gratitude. If people are most grateful when they most need the favor, a person in need is an opportunity to make an altruistic act go farthest. Guilt can rack a cheater who is in danger of being found out. H. L. Mencken defined conscience as "the inner voice which warns us that someone might be looking." If the victim responds by cutting off all future aid, the cheater will have paid dearly. He has an interest! in preventing the rupture by making up for the misdeed and keeping it from happening again. People feel guilty about private transgressions because Hotheads 405 they may become public; confessing a sin before it is discovered is evidence of sincerity and gives the victim better grounds to maintain the relationship. Shame, the reaction to a transgression after it has been discovered, evokes a public display of contrition, no doubt for the same reason. Lily Tomlin said, "I try to be cynical, but its hard to keep up." Trivers notes that once these emotions evolved, people had an incentive to mimic them to take advantage of other peoples reactions to the real thing. Sham generosity and friendship may induce genuine altruism in return. Sham moral anger when no real cheating took place may nonetheless win reparations. Sham guilt may convince a wronged party that the cheater has reformed his ways, even if cheating is about to resume. Feigning dire straits may evoke genuine sympathy. Sham sympathy which gives the appearance of helping may elicit real gratitude. Sham gratitude may mislead an altruist into expecting a favor to be reciprocated. Trivers notes that none of this hypocrisy need be conscious; indeed, as we shall see, it is most effective when it is not. The next round in this evolutionary contest is, of course, developing an ability to discriminate between real emotions and sham emotions. We get the evolution of trust and distrust. When we see someone going through the motions of generosity, guilt, sympathy, or gratitude rather than showing signs of the genuine emotion, we lose the desire to cooperate. For example, if a', 'and so on Each '),

The list should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with history, current events, or literature. There are a small number of plots in the worlds fiction and drama, and the scholar Georges Polti claims to have listed them all. More than eighty percent are defined by adversaries (often murderous), by tragedies of kinship or love, or both. In the real world, our life stories are largely stories of conflict: the hurts, guilts, and rivalries inflicted by parents, siblings, children, spouses, lovers, friends, and competitors. This chapter is about the psychology of social relations. The Age of Aquarius notwithstanding, that means it is largely about inborn motives that put us into conflict with one another. Given that our brains were shaped by natural selection, it could hardly be otherwise. Natural selection is driven by the competition among genes to be represented in the next generation. Reproduction leads to a geometric increase in descendants, and on a finite planet not every organism alive in one generation can have descendants several generations hence. Therefore organisms reproduce, to some extent, at one anothers expense. If one organism eats a fish, that fish is no longer available to be eaten by another organism. If one organism mates with a second one, it denies an opportunity at parenthood to a third. Everyone alive today is a descendant of millions of generations of ancestors who lived under these constraints but reproduced nonetheless. That means that all people today owe their existence to having winners as ancestors, and everyone today is designed, at least in some circumstances, to compete. That does not mean that people (or any other animals) house an aggressiye urge that must be discharged, an unconscious death wish, a rapacious sex drive, a territorial imperative, a thirst for blood, or the other 428 ruthless instincts that are often mistakenly equated with Darwinism. In The Godfather, Sollozzo says to Tom Hagen, "I dont like violence, Tom. Im a businessman. Blood is a big expense." Even in the harshest competition, an intelligent organism must be a strategist, assessing whether its goals might best be served by retreat, conciliation, or living and letting live. As I explained in Chapter 5, it is genes, not organisms, that must compete or die; sometimes the genes best strategy is to design organisms that cooperate, and yes, even smile on their brother and love one another. Natural selection does not forbid cooperation and generosity; it just makes them difficult engineering problems, like stereoscopic vision. The difficulty of building an organism to see in stereo has not prevented natural selection from installing stereo vision in humans, but we would never have come to understand stereo if we thought it just came free with having two eyes and failed to look for the sophisticated neural programs that accomplish it. Similarly, the difficulty of building an organism to cooperate and be generous has not prevented natural selection from installing cooperation and generosity in humans, but we will never understand these capacities if we think they just come free with living in groups. The on-board computers of social organisms, especially of humans, should run sophisticated programs that assess the opportunities and risks at hand and compete or cooperate accordingly.

Thinking Machines 121 actor : action ; acted upon Or would it? Alas, it would not. Consider these thoughts: Baby same-as baby. Baby different-from slug. Slug different-from baby. Slug same-as slug. No set of connection weights that allow "baby" in the first slot and "sameas" in the middle to turn on "baby" in the third slot, and that allow "baby" and "different-from" to turn on "slug," and that allow "slug" and "differentfrom" to turn on "baby," will also allow "slug" and "same-as" to turn on "slug." Its the exclusive-or problem in a different guise. If the baby-to-baby and same-to-baby links are strong, they will turn on "baby" in response to "baby same-as " (which is good), but they will also turn on "baby" in response to "baby different-from " (which is bad) and in response to "slug same-as " (also bad). Jigger the weights all you want; you will never find ones that work for all four sentences. Since any human can understand the four sentences without getting confused, the human mind must represent propositions with something more sophisticated than a set of concept-to-concept or concept-to-role associations. The mind needs a representation for the proposition itself. In this example, the model needs an extra layer of units most straightforwardly, a layer dedicated to representing the entire proposition, separately from the concepts and their proposition oooooooo ooooo oooo ooooo acted upon 122 I roles. The bottom of page 121 shows, in simplified form, a model devised by Geoffrey Hinton that does handle the sentences. The bank of "proposition" units light up in arbitrary patterns, a bit like serial numbers, that label complete thoughts. It acts as a superstructure keeping the concepts in each proposition in their proper slots. Note how closely the architecture of the network implements standard, languagelike mentalese! There have been other suggestions for compositional networks that arent such obvious mimics, but they all have to have some specially engineered parts that separate concepts from their roles and that bind each concept to its role properly. The ingredients of logic such as predicate, argument, and proposition, and the computational machinery to handle them, have to be snuck back in to get a model to do mindlike things; association-stuff by itself is not enough. Another mental talent that you may never have realized you have is called quantification, or variable-binding. It arises from a combination of the first problem, individuals, with the second, compositionality. Our compositional thoughts are, after all, often about individuals, and it makes a difference how those individuals are linked to the various parts of the thought. The thought that a particular baby ate a particular slug is different from the thought that a particular baby eats slugs in general, or that babies in general eat slugs in general. There is a family of jokes whose humor depends on the listener appreciating that difference. "Every forty-five seconds someone in the United States sustains a head injury." "Omigod! That poor guy!" When we hear that "Hildegard wants to marry a man with big musclesj" we wonder whether she has a particular he-man lined up or if she is just hanging hopefully around the gym.

The core of feminism is surely the goal of ending sexual discrimination and exploitation, an ethical and political position that is in no danger of being refuted by any foreseeable scientific theory or discovery. Even the spirit of the research poses no threat to feminist ideals. The sex differences that have been documented are in the psychology of reproduction, not in economic or political worth, and they are invidious with regard to men, not women. The differences should heighten awareness of incest, exploitation, harassment, stalking, battering, rape (including date rape and marital rape), and legal codes that discriminate against women. If they show that men are especially tempted to commit certain crimes against women, the implication is that the deterrents should be surer and more severe, not that the crimes are somehow less odious. Even evolutionary explanations of the traditional division of labor by sex do not imply that it is unchangeable, "natural" in the sense of good, or something that should be forced on individual women or men who dont want it. What evolutionary psychology challenges is not the goals of feminism, but parts of the modern orthodoxy about the mind that have been taken up by the intellectual establishment of feminism. One idea is that people are designed to carry out the interests of their class and sex, rather than to act out of their own beliefs and desires. A second is that the minds of children are formed by their parents, and the minds of adults are formed by language and by media images. A third is the romantic doctrine that our natural inclinations are good and that ignoble motives come from society. The unstated premise that nature is nice lies behind many of the objections to the Darwinian theory of human sexuality. Carefree sex is natural and good, it is assumed, so if someone claims that men want it more than women do, it would imply that men are mentally healthy and women neurotic and repressed. That conclusion is unacceptable, so the claim that men want carefree sex more than women do cannot be correct. Similarly, sexual desire is good, so if men rape for sex (rather than to Family Values 493 express anger towards women), rape would not be as evil. Rape is evil; therefore the claim that men rape for sex cannot be correct. More generally, what people instinctively like is good, so if people like beauty, beauty would be a sign of worth. Beauty is not a sign of worth, so the claim that people like beauty cannot be correct. These kinds of arguments combine bad biology (nature is nice), bad psychology (the mind is created by society), and bad ethics (what people like is good).

The economist Thorstein Veblen noticed that people sacrificed so many necessities of life to impress one another that they appear to be responding to a "higher, spiritual need." Status and virtue are close in peoples minds, as we see in words like chivalrous, classy, courtly, gentlemanly, honorable, noble, and princely, and their opposites ill-bred, low-class, low-rent, mean, nasty, rude, shabby, and shoddy.

One is that the values can be continuous rather than on or off, and hence they can represent the degree of truth or the probability of truth of some statement rather than dealing only with statements that are absolutely true or absolutely false. The second twist is that the network can, in many cases, be trained to take on the right weights by being fed with inputs and their correct outputs. On top of these twists there is an attitude: to take inspiration from the many connections among neurons in the brain and feel no guilt about going crazy with the number of gates and connections put into a network. That ethic allows one to design networks that compute many probabilities and hence that exploit the statistical redundancies among the features of the world. And that, in turn, allows neural networks to generalize from one input to similar inputs without further training, as long as the problem is one in which similar inputs yield similar outputs. Those are a few ideas on how to implement our smallest demons and their bulletin boards as vaguely neural machines. The ideas serve as a bridge, rickety for now, along the path of explanation that begins in the conceptual realm (Grandmas intuitive psychology and the varieties of knowledge, logic, and probability theory that underlie it), continues on to rules and representations (demons and symbols), and eventually arrives at real neurons. Neural networks also offer some pleasant surprises. In figuring out the minds software, ultimately we may use only demons stupid enough to be replaced by machines. If we seem to need a smarter demon, someone has to figure out how to build him out of stupider ones. It all goes faster, and sometimes goes differently, when neural-network modelers working from the neurons upward can build an inventory of stock demons that do handy things, like a content-addressable memory or an automatically generalizing pattern associator. The mental software engineers (actually, reverseengineers) have a good parts catalogue from which they can order smart demons. 112 CONNECTOPLASM Where do the rules and representations in mentalese leave off and the neural networks begin? Most cognitive scientists agree on the extremes. At the highest levels of cognition, where we consciously plod through steps and invoke rules we learned in school or discovered ourselves, the mind is something like a production system, with symbolic inscriptions in memory and demons that carry out procedures. At a lower level, the inscriptions and rules are implemented in something like neural networks, which respond to familiar patterns and associate them with other patterns. But the boundary is in dispute. Do simple neural networks handle the bulk of everyday thought, leaving only the products of booklearning to be handled by explicit rules and propositions? Or are the networks more like building blocks that arent humanly smart until they are assembled into structured representations and programs? A school called connectionism, led by the psychologists David Rumelhart and James McClelland, argues that simple networks by themselves can account for most of human intelligence. In its extreme form, connectionism says that the mind is one big hidden-layer back-propagation network, or perhaps a battery of similar or identical ones, and intelligence emerges when a trainer, the environment, tunes the connection weights. The only reason that humans are smarter', 'arbitrary road map of '),
(395, 22, 8, 'As one pedagogue lucidly explained A zone of potential construction of a specific mathematical concept is determined by the modifications of the concept children might make in, or as a result of, interactive communication in the mathematical learning environment." The result, another declared, is that "it is possible for students to construct for themselves the mathematical practices that, historically, took several thousand years to evolve." As Geary points out, constructivism has merit when it comes to the intuitions of small numbers and simple arithmetic that arise naturally in all children. But it ignores the difference between our factory-installed equipment and the accessories that civilization bolts on afterward. Setting our mental modules to work on material they were not designed for is hard. Children do not spontaneously see a string of beads as elements in a set, or points on a line as numbers. If you give them a bunch of blocks and tell them to do something together, they will exercise their intuitive physics and intuitive psychology for all theyre worth, but not necessarily their intuitive sense of number. (The better curricula explicitly point out connections across ways of knowing. Children might be told to do every arithmetic problem three different ways: by counting, by drawing diagrams, and by moving segments along a number line.) And without the practice that compiles a halting sequence of steps into a mental reflex, a learner will always be building mathematical structures out of the tiniest nuts and bolts, like the watchmaker who never made subassemblies and had to start from scratch every time he put down a watch to answer the phone. Mastery of mathematics is deeply satisfying, but it is a reward for hard work that is not itself always pleasurable. Without the esteem for hard-won mathematical skills that is common in other cultures, the mastery is unlikely to blossom. Sadly, the same story is being played out in American reading instruction. In the dominant technique, called "whole language," the insight that language is a naturally developing human instinct has been garbled into the evolutionarily improbable claim that reading is a naturally developing human instinct. Old-fashioned practice at connecting letters to sounds is replaced by immersion in a text-rich social environment, and the children dont learn to read. Without an understanding of what the mind was designed to do in the environment in which we evolved, the unnatural activity called formal education is unlikely to succeed. Good Ideas 343 "I shall never believe that God plays dice with the world," Einstein famously said. Whether or not he was right about quantum mechanics and the cosmos, his statement is certainly not true of the games people play in their daily lives. Life is not chess but backgammon, with a throw of the dice at every turn. As a result, it is hard to make predictions, especially about the future (as Yogi Berra allegedly said). But in a universe with any regularities at all, decisions informed by the past are better than decisions made at random. That has always been true, and we would expect organisms, especially informavores such as humans, to have evolved acute intuitions about probability. The founders of probability theory, like the founders of logic, assumed that they were just formalizing common sense. But then why do people often seem to be "probability-blind," in the words of Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini? Many mathematicians and scientists have bemoaned the innumeracy of ordinary people when they reason about risk. The psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman have amassed ingenious demonstrations of how peoples intuitive grasp of chance appears to flout the elementary canons of probability', 'As one pedagogue lucidly '),
(396, 23, 8, 'assembled out of materials from different locations and brought to Revenge of the Nerds 195 where they were most useful, and food and children could be carried to safe or productive areas. A final usher of intelligence was hunting. Hunting, tool use, and bipedalism were for Darwin the special trinity that powered human evolution. "Man the Hunter" was the major archetype in both serious and pop accounts through the 1960s. But the macho image that resonated with the decade of John Glenn and James Bond lost its appeal in the feminist-influenced small planet of the 1970s. A major problem for Man the Hunter was that it credited the growth of intelligence to the teamwork and foresight needed by men in groups to fell large game. But natural selection sums over the lives of both sexes. Women did not wait in the kitchen to cook the mastodon that Dad brought home, nor did they forgo the expansion of intelligence enjoyed by evolving men. The ecology of modern foraging peoples suggests that Woman the Gatherer provided a substantial portion of the calories in the form of highly processed plant foods, and that requires mechanical and biological acumen. And, of course, in a group-living species, social intelligence is as important a weapon as spears and clubs. But Tooby and DeVore have argued that hunting was nonetheless a major force in human evolution. The key is to ask not what the mind can do for hunting, but what hunting can do for the mind. Hunting provides sporadic packages of concentrated nutrients. We did not always have tofu, and the best natural material for building animal flesh is animal flesh. Though plant foods supply calories and other nutrients, meat is a complete protein containing all twenty amino acids, and provides energyrich fat and indispensable fatty acids. Across the mammals, carnivores have larger brains for their body size than herbivores, partly because of the greater skill it takes to subdue a rabbit than to subdue grass, and partly because meat can better feed ravenous brain tissue. Even in the most conservative estimates, meat makes up a far greater proportion of foraging humans diet than of any other primates. That may have been one of the reasons we could afford our expensive brains. Chimpanzees collectively hunt small animals like monkeys and bush pigs, so our common ancestor probably hunted as well. The move to the savanna must have made hunting more appealing. Notwithstanding the teeming wildlife in the Save-the-Rainforest posters, real forests have few large animals. Only so much solar energy falls on a patch of ground, and if the biomass it supports is locked up in wood it is not available to make animals. But grass is like the legendary self-replenishing goblet, growing 196 J back as soon as it is grazed. Grasslands can feed vast herds of herbivores, who in turn feed carnivores. Evidence of butchery appears in the fossil record almost two million years ago, the time of Homo habilis. Hunting must be even older, since we know that chimpanzees do it, and their activities would not leave evidence in the fossil record. Once our ancestors increased their hunting, the world opened up. Plant foods are scarce during the winter at higher altitudes and latitudes, but hunters can survive there. There are no vegetarian Eskimos. Our ancestors have sometimes been characterized as meek scavengers rather than brave hunters, in keeping with todays machismopuncturing ethos. But while hominids may occasionally have scavenged, they probably could not have made a living from it, and if they did, they were no wimps. Vultures get away with scavenging', 'assembled out of materials '),

A canvas that is cleanly divided into solid shapes and continuous backgrounds may exaggerate the reduction of anxiety we experience when we find viewing conditions that resolve the visual field into unambiguous surfaces and objects. Finally, we find some parts of the world snazzy and other parts dreary to the extent that they convey information about improbable, informa528 tion-rich, consequential objects and forces. Imagine scooping out the entire scene in front of you, putting it in a giant blender set on LIQUEFY, and pouring the detritus back in front of you. The scene no longer contains any object of interest. Any food, predators, shelter, hiding places, vantage points, tools, and raw materials have been ground into sludge. And what does it look like? It has no lines, no shapes, no symmetry, and no repetition. It is brown, just like the color you got when you mixed all your paints together as a child. It has nothing to look at because it has nothing in it. The thought experiment shows that drabness comes from an environment with nothing to offer, and its opposite, visual pizzazz, comes from an environment that contains objects worth paying attention to. Thus we are designed to be dissatisfied by bleak, featureless scenes and attracted to colorful, patterned ones. We push that pleasure button with vivid artificial colors and patterns. Music is an enigma. In Much Ado About Nothing, Benedick asks, "Is it not strange that sheeps guts should hale souls out of mens bodies?" In all cultures, certain rhythmic sounds give listeners intense pleasure and heartfelt emotions. What benefit could there be to diverting time and energy to the making of plinking noises, or to feeling sad when no one has died? Many suggestions have been made music bonds the social group, coordinates action, enhances ritual, releases tension but they just pass the enigma along rather than explaining it. Why do rhythmic sounds bond the group, dissipate tension, and so on? As far as biological cause and effect are concerned, music is useless. It shows no signs of design for attaining a goal such as long life, grandchildren, or accurate perception and prediction of the world. Compared with language, vision, social reasoning, and physical know-how, music could vanish from our species and the rest of our lifestyle would be virtually unchanged. Music appears to be a pure pleasure technology, a cocktail of recreational drugs that we ingest through the ear to stimulate a mass of pleasure circuits at once. "Music is the universal language," says the cliche, but that is mislead - ing. Anyone who lived through the craze for Indian raga music after George Harrison made it hip in the 1960s appreciates that musical styles vary from culture to culture and that people most enjoy the idiom they The Meaning of Life 529 grew up with. (During the Concert for Bangladesh, Harrison was mortified when the audience applauded Ravi Shankar for tuning up his sitar.) Musical sophistication also varies across people, cultures, and historical periods in ways that language does not. All neurologically normal children spontaneously speak and understand complex language, and the complexity of spoken vernaculars varies little across cultures and periods. In contrast, while everyone enjoys listening to music, many people cannot carry a tune, fewer can play an instrument, and those who can play need explicit training and extensive practice.

It turns into a fuzzy category whose boundaries are defined by similarity, without a crisp scientific definition. Fish, for example, do not occupy one branch in the tree of life. One of their kind, a lungfish, begot the amphibians, whose descendants embrace the reptiles, whose descendants embrace the birds and the mammals. There is no definition that picks out all and only the fish, no branch of the tree of life that includes salmon and lungfish but excludes lizards and cows. Taxonomists fiercely debate what to do with categories like fish that are obvious to any child but have no scientific definition because they are neither species nor clades. Some insist that there is no such thing as a fish; it is merely a laypersons stereotype. Others try to rehabilitate everyday categories like fish using computer algorithms that sort creatures into clusters sharing properties. Still others wonder what the fuss is about; they see categories like families and orders as matters of convenience and taste which similarities are important for the discussion at hand. Classification is particularly fuzzy at the stump where a branch was hacked off, that is, the extinct species that became the inauspicious ancestor of a new group. The fossil Archaeopteryx, thought to be the ancestor of the birds, has been described by one paleontologist as "a pisspoor reptile, and not very much of a bird." The anachronistic shoehorning of extinct animals into the modern categories they spawned was a bad habit of early paleontologists, dramatically recounted in Goulds Wonderful Life. So the world sometimes presents us with fuzzy categories, and registering their similarities is the best we can do. Now we may turn the question around. Does the world ever present us with crisp categories? In his book Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things, named after a fuzzy grammatical category in an Australian language, the linguist George Lakoff argues that pristine categories are fictions. They are artifacts of the bad habit of seeking definitions, a habit that we inherited from Aristotle and now must shake off. He defies his readers to find a sharp-edged category in 312 the world. Crank up the microscope, and the boundaries turn to fuzz. Take a textbook example, "mother," a category with the seemingly straightforward definition "female parent." Oh, yeah? What about surrogate mothers? Adoptive mothers? Foster mothers? Egg donors? Or take species. A species, unlike the controversial larger categories like "fish," is supposed to have a clear definition: usually, a population of organisms whose members can mate to form fertile offspring. But even that vaporizes under scrutiny. There are widely dispersed, gradually varying species in which an animal from the western edge of the range can mate with an animal from the center, and an animal from the center can mate with an animal from the east, but an animal from the west cannot mate with an animal from the east. The observations are interesting, but I think they miss an important point. Systems of rules are idealizations that abstract away from complicating aspects of reality. They are never visible in pure form, but are no less real for all that. No one has ever actually sighted a triangle without thickness, a frictionless plane, a point mass, an ideal gas, or an infinite, randomly interbreeding population. That is not because they are useless figments but because they are masked by the complexity and finiteness of the world and by many layers of noise. The concept of "mother" is perfectly well defined within', 'be hacked off to '),
(399, 26, 8, 'because if I liked it Id eat it, and I just hate it." Inorganic and non-nutritive stuff like sand, cloth, and bark are simply avoided, without strong feelings. Not only are disgusting things always from animals, but things from animals are almost always disgusting. The nondisgusting animal parts are the exception. Of all the parts of all the animals in creation, people eat an infinitesimal fraction, and everything else is untouchable. Many Americans eat only the skeletal muscle of cattle, chickens, swine, and a few fish. Other parts, like guts, brains, kidneys, eyes, and feet, are beyond the pale, and so is any part of any animal not on the list: dogs, pigeons, jellyfish, slugs, toads, insects, and the other millions of animal species. Some Americans are even pickier, and are repulsed by the dark meat of chicken or chicken on the bone. Even adventurous eaters are willing to sample only a small fraction of the animal kingdom. And it is not just pampered Americans who are squeamish about unfamiliar animal parts. Napoleon Chagnon safeguarded his supply of peanut butter and hot dogs from his begging Yanomamo informants by telling them they were the feces and penises of cattle. The Yanomamo, who are hearty eaters of caterpillars and grubs, had no idea what cattle were but lost their appetite and left him to eat in peace. A disgusting object contaminates everything it touches, no matter how brief the contact or how invisible the effects. The intuition behind not drinking a beverage that has been stirred with a flyswatter or dunked with a sterilized roach is that invisible contaminating bits children call them cooties have been left behind. Some objects, such as a new comb or bedpan, are tainted merely because they are designed to touch something disgusting, and others, such as a chocolate dog turd, are tainted by mere resemblance. Rozin observes that the psychology of disgust obeys Hotheads 381 the two laws of sympathetic magic voodoo found in many traditional cultures: the law of contagion (once in contact, always in contact) and the law of similarity (like produces like). Though disgust is universal, the list of nondisgusting animals differs from culture to culture, and that implies a learning process. As every parent knows, children younger than two put everything in their mouths, and psychoanalysts have had a field day interpreting their lack of revulsion for feces. Rozin and his colleagues studied the development of disgust by offering children various foods that American adults find disgusting. To the horror of their onlooking parents, sixty-two percent of toddlers ate imitation dog feces ("realistically crafted from peanut butter and odorous cheese"), and thirty-one percent ate a grasshopper. Rozin suggests that disgust is learned in the middle school-age years, perhaps when children are scolded by their parents or they see the look on their parents faces when they approach a disgusting object. But I find that unlikely. First, all the subjects older than toddlers behaved virtually the same as the adults did. For example, four-year-olds wouldnt eat imitation feces or drink juice with a grasshopper in it; the only difference between them and the adults was that the children were less sensitive to contamination by brief contact. (Not until the age of eight did the children reject juice briefly dipped with a grasshopper or with imitation dog feces.) Second, children above the age of two are notoriously finicky, and their parents struggle to get them to eat new substances, not to avoid old ones. (The anthropologist Elizabeth Cashdan has documented that childrens willingness to try new foods plummets after the third birthday.) Third, if children', 'because if I liked '),

The translucent cells could undergo random mutations of their refractive index: their ability to bend light, Which in real life often corresponds to density. All the cells could undergo small mutations affecting their size and thickness. In the simulation, the cells in the slab were allowed to mutate randomly, and after each round of mutation the program calculated the spatial resolution of an image projected onto the slab by a nearby object. If a bout of mutations improved the resolution, the mutations were retained as the starting point for the next bout, as if the slab belonged to a lineage of organisms whose survival depended on reacting to looming predators. As in real evolution, there was no master plan or project scheduling. The organism could not put up with a less effective detector in the short run even if its patience would have been rewarded by the best conceivable detector in the long run. Every change it retained had to be an improvement. Satisfyingly, the model evolved into a complex eye right on the computer screen. The slab indented and then deepened into a cup; the transparent layer thickened to fill the cup and bulged out to form a cornea. Inside the clear filling, a spherical lens with a higher refractive index emerged in just the right place, resembling in many subtle details the excellent optical design of a fishs eye. To estimate how long it would take in real time, rather than in computer time, for an eye to unfold, Nilsson and Pelger built in pessimistic assumptions about heritability, variation in the population, and the size of the selective advantage, and even forced the mutations to take place in only one part of the "eye" each generation. Nonetheless, the entire sequence in which flat skin became a complex eye took only four hundred thousand generations, a geological instant. Revenge of the Nerds 165 I have reviewed the modern case for the theory of natural selection because so many people are hostile to it. I dont mean fundamentalists from the Bible Belt, but professors at Americas most distinguished universities from coast to coast. Time and again I have heard the objections: the theory is circular, what good is half an eye, how can structure arise from random mutation, there hasnt been enough time, Gould has disproved it, complexity just emerges, physics will make it obsolete someday. People desperately want Darwinism to be wrong. Dennetts diagnosis in Darwins Dangerous Idea is that natural selection implies there is no plan to the universe, including human nature. No doubt that is a reason, though another is that people who study the mind would rather not have to think about how it evolved because it would make a hash of cherished theories. Various scholars have claimed that the mind is innately equipped with fifty thousand concepts (including "carburetor" and "trombone"), that capacity limitations prevent the human brain from solving problems that are routinely solved by bees, that language is designed for beauty rather than for use, that tribal people kill their babies to protect the ecosystem from human overpopulation, that children harbor an unconscious wish to copulate with their parents, and that people could just as easily be conditioned to enjoy the thought of their spouse being unfaithful as to be upset by the thought. When advised that these claims are evolutionarily improbable, they attack the theory of evolution rather than rethinking the claim.

A Kpelle could be forgiven for asking, Look, do you want to know whether Yakpalo is drinking cane juice, or dont you? That is true for both the knowledge acquired by an individual and the knowledge acquired by the species. No organism needs content-free algorithms applicable to any problem no matter how esoteric. Our ancestors encountered certain problems for hundreds of thousands or millions of years recognizing objects, making tools, learning the local language, finding a mate, predicting an animals movement, finding their way and encountered certain other problems never putting a man on the moon, growing better popcorn, proving Fermats last theorem. The knowledge that solves a familiar kind of problem is often irrelevant to any other one. The effect of slant on luminance is useful in calculating shape but not in assessing the fidelity of a potential mate. The effects of lying on tone of voice help with fidelity but not with shape. Natural selection does not care about the ideals of a liberal education and should have no qualms about building parochial inference modules that exploit eons-old regularities in their own subject matters. Tooby and Cosmides call the subject-specific intelligence of our species "ecological rationality." A second reason we did not evolve into true scientists is the cost of knowledge. Science is expensive, and not just the superconducting supercollider, but the elementary analysis of cause and effect in John Stuart Mills canons of induction. Recently I was dissatisfied with the bread I had been baking because it was too dry and fluffy. So I increased the water, decreased the yeast, and lowered the temperature. To this day I dont know which of these manipulations made the difference. The scientist in me knew that the proper procedure would have been to try out all eight logical combinations in a factorial design: more water, same yeast, same temperature; more water, more yeast, same temperature; more water, same yeast, lower temperature; and so on. But the experiment would have taken eight days (twenty-seven if I wanted to test two increments of each factor, sixty-four if I wanted to test three) and required a notebook and a calculator. I wanted tasty bread, not a contribution to the archives of human knowledge, so my multiply-confounded one-shot was enough. In a large society with writing and institutionalized science, the cost of an exponential number of tests is repaid by the benefit of the Good Ideas 305 resulting laws to a large number of people. That is why taxpayers are willing to fund scientific research. But for the provincial interests of a single individual or even a small band, good science isnt worth the trouble. A third reason we are so-so scientists is that our brains were shaped for fitness, not for truth. Sometimes the truth is adaptive, but sometimes it is not. Conflicts of interest are inherent to the human condition (see Chapters 6 and 7), and we are apt to want our version of the truth, rather than the truth itself, to prevail. For example, in all societies, expertise is distributed unevenly. Our mental apparatus for understanding the world, even for understanding the meanings of simple words, is designed to work in a society in which we can consult an expert when we have to.

The Meaning of Life 535 That suggests that music borrows some of its mental machinery from language in particular, from prosody, the contours of sound that span many syllables. The metrical structure of strong and weak beats, the intonation contour of rising and falling pitch, and the hierarchical grouping of phrases within phrases all work in similar ways in language and in music. The parallel may account for the gut feeling that a musical piece conveys a complex message, that it makes assertions by introducing topics and commenting on them, and that it emphasizes some portions and whispers others as asrdes. Music has been called "heightened speech," and it can literally grade into speech. Some singers slip into "talking on pitch" instead of carrying the melody, like Bob Dylan, Lou Reed, and Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady. They sound halfway between animated raconteurs and tone-deaf singers. Rap music, ringing oratory from preachers, and poetry are other intermediate forms. 2. Auditory scene analysis. Just as the eye receives a jumbled mosaic of patches and must segregate surfaces from their backdrops, the ear receives a jumbled cacophony of frequencies and must segregate the streams of sound that come from different sources the soloist in an orchestra, a voice in a noisy room, an animal call in a chirpy forest, a howling wind among rustling leaves. Auditory perception is inverse acoustics: the input is a sound wave, the output a specification of the soundmakers in the world that gave rise to it. The psychologist Albert Bregman has worked out the principles of auditory scene analysis and has shown how the brain strings together the notes of a melody as if it were a stream of sound coming from a single soundmaker. One of the brains tricks as it identifies the soundmakers in the world is to pay attention to harmonic relations. The inner ear dissects a blare into its component frequencies, and the brain glues some of the components back together and perceives them as a complex tone. Components that stand in harmonic relations a component at one frequency, another component at twice that frequency, yet another component at three times the frequency, and so on are grouped together and perceived as a single tone rather than as separate tones. Presumably the brain glues them together to make our perception of sound reflect reality. Simultaneous sounds in harmonic relations, the brain guesses, are probably the overtones of a single sound coming from one soundmaker in the world. That is a good guess because many resonators, such as plucked strings, struck hollow bodies, and calling animals, emit sounds composed of many harmonic overtones. 536 What does this have to do with melody? Tonal melodies are sometimes said to be "serialized overtones." Building a melody is like slicing a complex harmonic sound into its overtones and laying them end to end in a particular order. Perhaps melodies are pleasing to the ear for the same reason that symmetrical, regular, parallel, repetitive doodles are pleasing to the eye. They exaggerate the experience of being in an environment that contains strong, clear, analyzable signals from interesting, potent objects. A visual environment that cannot be seen clearly or that is composed of homogeneous sludge looks like a featureless sea of brown or gray. An auditory environment that cannot be heard clearly or that is composed of homogeneous noise sounds like a featureless stream of radio static.

During your first basketball game, you see blond players with green jerseys run toward the east basket with the ball, and black players with yellow jerseys run toward the west basket with the ball. The whistle blows and a black player with a green jersey enters. Which basket will he run to? Everyone knows it is the east basket. These similarity-defying guesses come from intuitive theories about aging, weather, economic exchange, biology, and social coalitions. They belong to larger systems of tacit assumptions about kinds of things and the laws governing them. The laws can be played out combinatorially in the mind to get predictions and inferences about events unseen. People everywhere have homespun ideas about physics, to predict how objects roll and bounce; psychology, to predict what other people think and do; 310 logic, to derive some truths from others; arithmetic, to predict the effects of aggregating; biology, to reason about living things and their powers; kinship, to reason about relatedness and inheritance; and a \ variety of social and legal rule systems. The bulk of this chapter explores those intuitive theories. But first we must ask: when does the world allow theories (scientific or intuitive) to work, and when does it force us all to fall back on fuzzy categories defined by similarity and stereotypes? Where do our fuzzy similarity clusters come from? Are they just the parts of the world that we understand so poorly that the underlying laws escape us? Or does the world really have fuzzy categories even in our best scientific understanding? The answer depends on what part of the world we look at. Mathematics, physics, and chemistry trade in crisp categories that obey theorems and laws, such as triangles and electrons. But in any realm in which history plays a role, such as biology, members drift in and out of lawful categories over time, leaving their boundaries ragged. Some of the categories are definable, but others really are fuzzy. Most biologists consider species to be lawful categories: they are populations that have become reproductively isolated and adapted to their local environment. Adaptation to a niche and inbreeding homogenize the population, so a species at a given time is a real category in the world that taxonomists can identify using well-defined criteria. But a higher taxonomic category, representing the descendants of an ancestral species, is not as well behaved. When the ancestral organisms dispersed and their descendants lost touch and adopted new homelands, the original pretty picture became a palimpsest. Robins, penguins, and ostriches share some features, like feathers, because they are great-great-grandchildren of a single population adapted to flight. They differ because ostriches are African and adapted to running and penguins are Antarctic and adapted to swimming. Flying, once a badge of all the birds, is now merely part of their stereotype. For birds, at least, there is a kind of crisp biological category into which they can be fitted: a clade, exactly one branch of the genealogical tree of organisms. The branch represents the descendants of a single ancestral population. But not all of our familiar animal categories can be pegged onto one branch.

Theres a real silence about the ambivalent feelings;its tantamount to being a bad mother. [In my clinical practice], anger and rage are normal. Children are endlessly demanding, and theyll just suck you dry. Women shouldnt have to feel that they are supposed to meet all of the childs needs. But the myth is that mother love is natural and operative at all times. Even the advocates of mothers rights often feel they must frame their arguments in terms of the interests of the child (an overburdened mother is a bad mother) rather than in terms of the interests of the mother (an overburdened mother is unhappy). More conservative social critics have also begun to notice that parents and childrens interests can diverge. Barbara Dafoe Whitehead has reviewed data showing that sex education does not succeed in its advertised function of reducing teenage pregnancies. Todays teens know all about sex and its hazards, but the girls end up pregnant anyway, quite possibly because they dont mind the idea of having babies. If the teens parents do mind, they may have to enforce their interests by controlling the teenagers (with chaperones and curfews), not just by educating them. I mention these debates not to take a side but to call attention to the long reach of parent-offspring conflict.

The evolution-free discourse that has prevailed for decades has treated childrearing as a technological problem of determining which practices grow the best children. Trivers insight is that decisions about childrearing are inherently about how to allocate a scarce resource the parents time and effort to which several parties have a legitimate claim. As such, childrearing will always be partly a question of ethics and politics, not just of psychology and biology. B R O T H E R S A N D SISTERSEver since Cain slew Abel, siblings have been entangled by many emotions. As people of the same generation who know each other well, they react to each other as individuals: they may like or dislike one another, compete if they are of the same sex, or feel sexual attraction if they are 452 J not. As close kin, they feel a big extra dose of affection and solidarity. But though they share fifty percent of their genes with each other, each sibling shares one hundred percent of its genes with itself, so brotherly or sisterly love has its limits. Being offspring of the same parents, siblings are rivals for their parents investment, from weaning to the reading of the will. And though genetic overlap makes a pair of siblings natural allies, it also makes them unnatural parents, and that genetic alchemy tempers their sexual feelings. If people gave birth to a single litter of interchangeable w-tuplets, parent-offspring conflict would be a raw struggle among the siblings, each demanding more than its share. But all children are different, if for no other reason than that they are born at different times. Parents', 'child and to take '),

These skills develop slowly, unevenly, or not at all. On evolutionary grounds it would be surprising if children were mentally equipped for school mathematics. These tools were invented recently in history and only in a few cultures, too late and too local to stamp the human genome. The mothers of these inventions were the recording and trading of farming surpluses in the first agricultural civilizations. Thanks to formal schooling and written language (itself a recent, noninstinctive invention), the inventions could accumulate over the millennia, and simple mathematical operations could be assembled into more and more complicated ones. Written symbols could serve as a medium of computation that surmounted the limitations of short-term memory, just as silicon chips do today. How can people use their Stone Age minds to wield high-tech mathematical instruments? The first way is to set mental modules to work on Good Ideas 341 objects other than the ones they were designed for. Ordinarily, lines and shapes are analyzed by imagery and other components of our spatial sense, and heaps of things are analyzed by our number faculty. But to accomplish Mac Lanes ideal of disentangling the generic from the parochial (for example, disentangling the generic concept of quantity from the parochial concept of the number of rocks in a heap), people might have to apply their sense of number to an entity that, at first, feels like the wrong kind of subject matter. For example, people might have to analyze a line in the sand not by the habitual imagery operations of continuous scanning and shifting, but by counting off imaginary segments from one end to the other. The second way to get to mathematical competence is similar to the way to get to Carnegie Hall: practice. Mathematical concepts come from snapping together old concepts in a useful new arrangement. But those old concepts are assemblies of still older concepts. Each subassembly hangs together by the mental rivets called chunking and automaticity: with copious practice, concepts adhere into larger concepts, and sequences of steps are compiled into a single step. Just as bicycles are assembled out of frames and wheels, not tubes and spokes, and recipes say how to make sauces, not how to grasp spoons and open jars, mathematics is learned by fitting together overlearned routines. Calculus teachers lament that students find the subject difficult not because derivatives and integrals are abstruse concepts theyre just rate and accumulation but because you cant do calculus unless algebraic operations are second nature, and most students enter the course without having learned the algebra properly and need to concentrate every drop of mental energy on that. Mathematics is ruthlessly cumulative, all the way back to counting to ten. Evolutionary psychology has implications for pedagogy which are particularly clear in the teaching of mathematics. American children are among the worst performers in the industrialized world on tests of mathematical achievement. They are not born dunces; the problem is that the educational establishment is ignorant of evolution. The ascendant philosophy of mathematical education in the United States is constructivism, a mixture of Piagets psychology with counterculture and postmodernist ideology. Children must actively construct mathematical knowledge for themselves in a social enterprise driven by disagreements about the meanings of concepts. The teacher provides the materials and the social milieu but does not lecture or guide the discussion. Drill and 342 practice, the routes to automaticity, are called "mechanistic" and seen as detrimental to', 'Children he suggests are '),

A man and a woman need each others DNA and hence can enjoy sex. A man and a woman have a common interest in their children, and their enduring love has evolved to protect that interest. And a husband and wife can be each others best friends, and can enjoy the lifelong dependability and trust that underlies the logic of friendship (more on this later). These emotions are rooted in the fact that if a man and woman are monogamous, together for life, and not nepotistic toward their own families, their genetic interests are identical. Unfortunately, that is a big "if." Even the happiest couples can fight like cats and dogs, and today fifty percent of marriages in the United States end in divorce. George Bernard Shaw wrote, "When we want to read of the deeds that are done for love, whither do we turn? To the murder column." Conflict between men and women, sometimes deadly, Family Values 461 is universal, and it suggests that sex is not a bonding force in human affairs but a divisive one. Once again, that banality must be stated because the conventional wisdom denies it. One of the Utopian ideals of the 1960s, reiterated ever since by sex gurus like Dr. Ruth, is the intensely erotic, mutually enjoyable, guilt-free, emotionally open, lifelong monogamous pair-bond. The alternative from the counterculture was the intensely erotic, mutually enjoyable, guilt-free, emotionally open, round-robin orgy. Both were attributed to our hominid ancestors, to earlier stages of civilization, or to primitive tribes still out there somewhere. Both are as mythical as the Garden of Eden. The battle between the sexes is not just a skirmish in the war between unrelated individuals but is fought in a different theater, for reasons first explained by Donald Symons. "With respect to human sexuality," he wrote, "there is a female human nature and a male human nature, and these natures are extraordinarily different.Men and women differ in their sexual natures because throughout the immensely long hunting and gathering phase of human evolutionary history the sexual desires and dispositions that were adaptive for either sex were for the other tickets to reproductive oblivion." Many people deny that there are any interesting differences between the sexes. At my own institution, students taking Psychology of Gender used to be taught that the only well-established difference between men and women is that men like women and women like men. Symons two human natures are dismissed as "gender stereotypes," as if that were proof that they are false. The belief that spiders spin webs and pigs dont is also a stereotype, but is no less true for that. As we shall see, some stereotypes about sexual feelings have been verified beyond a reasonable doubt. In fact, researchers in sex differences have found that many gender stereotypes underestimate the documented differences between the sexes. Why is there sex to begin with? Lord Chesterfield noted of sex that "the pleasure is momentary, the position ridiculous, and the expense damnable." Biologically speaking, the costs are damnable indeed, so why do almost all complex organisms reproduce sexually? Why dont women give virgin birth to daughters who are clones of themselves instead of 462 J wasting half their pregnancies on sons who lack the machinery to make grandchildren and are nothing but sperm donors? Why do people and other organisms swap out half their genes for the genes of another member of the species, generating variety', 'course it does work '),

Many events work like that. They have a characteristic life history, a changing probability of occurring over time which statisticians call a hazard function. An astute observer should commit the gamblers fallacy and try to predict the next occurrence of an event from its history so far, a kind of statistics called time-series analysis. There is one exception: devices that are designed to deliver events independently of their history. What kind of device would do that? We call them gambling machines. Their reason for being is to foil an observer who likes to turn patterns into predictions. If our love of patterns were misbegotten because randomness is everywhere, gambling machines should be easy to build and gamblers easy to fool. In fact, roulette wheels, slot machines, even dice, cards, and coins are precision instruments; they are demanding to manufacture and easy to defeat. Card counters who "commit the gamblers fallacy" in blackjack by remembering the dealt cards and betting they wont turn up again soon are the pests of Las Vegas. So in any world but a casino, the gamblers fallacy is rarely a fallacy. Indeed, calling our intuitive predictions fallacious because they fail on gambling devices is backwards. A gambling device is, by definition, a machine designed to defeat our intuitive predictions. It is like calling our hands badly designed because they make it hard to get out of handcuffs. The same is true of the hot-hand illusion and other fallacies among sports fans. If basketball shots were easily predictable, we would no longer call basketball a sport. An efficient stock market is another invenGood Ideas 347 tion designed to defeat human pattern detection. It is set up to let traders quickly capitalize on, hence nullify, deviations from a random walk. Other so-called fallacies may also be triggered by evolutionary novelties that trick our probability calculators, rather than arising from crippling design defects. "Probability" has many meanings. One is relative frequency in the long run. "The probability that the penny will land heads is .5" would mean that in a hundred coin flips, fifty will be heads. Another meaning is subjective confidence about the outcome of a single event. In this sense, "the probability that the penny will land heads is .5" would mean that on a scale of 0 to 1, your confidence that the next flip will be heads is halfway between certainty that it will happen and certainty that it wont. Numbers referring to the probability of a single event, which only make sense as estimates of subjective confidence, are commonplace nowadays: there is a thirty percent chance of rain tomorrow; the Canadiens are favored to beat the Mighty Ducks tonight with odds of five to three. But the mind may have evolved to think of probabilities as relative frequencies in the long run, not as numbers expressing confidence in a single event. The mathematics of probability was invented only in the seventeenth century, and the use of proportions or percentages to express them arose even later. (Percentages came in after the French Revolution with the rest of the metric system and were initially used for interest and tax rates.) Still more modern is the input to the formulas for probability: data gathered by teams, recorded in writing,', 'cover must have some '),

Even a quick sideby- side comparison shows that the primate brain must have been considerably re-engineered to end up as a human brain. Our brains are about three times too big for a generic monkey or ape of our body size. The inflation is accomplished by prolonging fetal brain growth for a vear after birth. If our bodies grew proportionally during that period, we would be ten feet tall and weigh half a ton. The major lobes and patches of the brain have been revamped as well. The olfactory bulbs, which underlie the sense of smell, have shriveled to a third of the expected primate size (already puny by mammalian standards), and the main cortical areas for vision and movement have shrunk proportionally as well. Within the visual system, the first slop for information, the primary visual cortex, takes up a smaller proportion ol the whole brain, while the later areas for complex-form processing expand, as do the temporoparietal areas that shunt visual information to the language and conceptual regions. The areas for hearing, especially 184 I for understanding speech, have grown, and the prefrontal lobes, the scat of deliberate thought and planning, have ballooned to twice what a primate our size should have. While the brains of monkeys and apes are subtly asymmetrical, the human brain, especially in the areas devoted to language, is so lopsided that the two hemispheres can be distinguished by shape in the jar. And there have been takeovers of primate brain areas for new functions, Urocas area, involved in speech, has a homoiogue (evolutionary counterpart) in monkeys, but they obviously dont use it for speech, and they dont even seem to use it to produce shrieks, barks, and other calls. ^^^^^^^^^^m Its interesting to find these differences, but the human hrain could be radically different from an apes brain even if one looked like a perfect scale model of the other. The real action is in the patterns of connections among neurons, just as the differences in content among different computer programs, microchips, hooks, or videoeassettes lie not in their gross shapes but in the combinatorial arrangements of their tiny constituents. Virtually nothing is known about the functioning microcircuitry erf the human brain, because there is a shortage of volunteers willing to give up their brains to science before they are dead. If we could somehow read the code in the neural circuitry of growing humans and apes, we would surely find substantial differences. Are the marvelous algorithms of animals mere "instincts" that we have lost or risen above?

Darwin called human language, the epitome of flexible behavior, "an instinct to acquire an art" (giving me the title for The Language Instinct), and his follower William James pressed the point; Nou, why do the various animals do what seem to us such strange things, in the presence of such outlandish stimuli?

A fourth alternative is random genetic drift. Beneficial traits are beneficial only on average. Actual creatures suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. When the number of individuals in a generation is small enough, an advantageous trait can vanish if its bearers are unlucky, and a disadvantageous or neutral one can take over if its bearers are lucky. Genetic drift can, in principle, explain why a population has a simple trait, like being dark or light, or an inconsequential trait,; like the sequence of DNA bases in a part of the chromosome that doesnt do anything. But because of its very randomness, random drift cannot explain the appearance of an improbable, useful trait like an ability to see or fly. The required organs need hundreds or thousands of parts to work, and the odds are astronomically stacked against the required genes accumulating by sheer chance. Dawkins argument about extraterrestrial life is a timeless claim about the logic of evolutionary theories, about the power of an explanans to cause the explanandum. And indeed his argument works against two subsequent challenges. One is a variant of Lamarckism called directed or adaptive mutation. Wouldnt it be nice if an organism could react to an environmental challenge with a slew of new mutations, and not wasteful, random ones, but mutations for traits that would allow it to cope? Of course it would be nice, and thats the problem chemistry has no sense of niceness. The DNA inside the testes and ovaries cannot peer outside and considerately mutate to make fur when its cold and fins when its wet and claws when there are trees around, or to put a lens in front of the retina as opposed to between the toes or inside the pancreas. That is why a cornerstone of evolutionary theory indeed, a cornerstone of the scientific worldview is that mutations are indifferent overall to the benefits they confer on the organism. They cannot be adaptive in general, though of course a tiny few can be adaptive by chance. The periodic announcements of discoveries of "adaptive mutations" inevitably turn out to be laboratory curiosities or artifacts. No mechanism short of a guardian angel can guide mutations to respond to organisms needs in general, there being billions of kinds of organisms, each with thousands of needs. The other challenge comes from the fans of a new field called the theory of complexity. The theory looks for mathematical principles of order underlying many complex systems: galaxies, crystals, weather sysRevenge of the Nerds 161 terns, cells, organisms, brains, ecosystems, societies, and so on. Dozens of new books have applied these ideas to topics such as AIDS, urban decay, the Bosnian war, and, of course, the stock market. Stuart Kauffman, one of the movements leaders, suggested that feats like self-organization, order, stability, and coherence may be an "innate property of some complex systems." Evolution, he suggests, may be a "marriage of selection and self-organization." Complexity theory raises interesting issues. Natural selection presupposes that a replicator arose somehow, and complexity theory might help explain the "somehow." Complexity theory might also pitch in to explain other assumptions.

(If they are, they spend a quarter of an hour working it out and then announce that the problem is "trivial.") When it comes to these motions, video animations of impossible events look quite natural. Indeed, possible events look unnatural: a spinning Good Ideas 321 top, which leans without falling, is an object of wonder to all of us, even physicists. It is not surprising to find that the mind is non-Newtonian. The idealized motions of classical mechanics are visible only in perfectly elastic point masses moving in vacuums on frictionless planes. In the real world, Newtons laws are masked by friction from the air, the ground, and the objects own molecules. With friction slowing everything that moves and keeping stationary objects in place, its natural to conceive of objects as having an inherent tendency toward rest. As historians of science have noted, it would be hard to convince a medieval European struggling to free an oxcart from the mud that an object in motion continues at a constant speed along a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. Complicated motions like spinning tops and rolling wheels have a double disadvantage. They depend on evolutionarily unprecedented machines with negligible friction, and their motions are governed by complex equations that relate many variables at once; our perceptual system can handle only one at a time even in the best of circumstances. Even the brainiest baby has a lot to learn. Children grow up in a world of sand, Velcro, glue, Nerf balls, rubbed balloons, dandelion seeds, boomerangs, television remote controls, objects suspended by near-invisible fishing line, and countless other objects whose idiosyncratic properties overwhelm the generic predictions of Newtons laws. The precociousness that infants show in the lab does not absolve them of learning about objects; it makes the learning possible. If children did not carve the world into objects, or if they were prepared to believe that objects could magically disappear and reappear anywhere, they would have no pegs on which to hang their discoveries of stickiness, fluffiness, squishiness, and so on. Nor could they develop the intuitions captured in Aristotles theory, the impetus theory, Newtons theory, or Wile E. Coyotes theory. An intuitive physics relevant to our middle-sized world has to refer to enduring matter and its lawful motions, and infants see the world in those terms from the beginning. Here is the plot of a movie. A protagonist strives to attain a goal. An antagonist interferes. Thanks to a helper, the protagonist finally succeeds. This movie does not feature a swashbuckling hero aided by a 322 I romantic interest to foil a dastardly villain. Its stars are three dots. One dot moves some distance up an inclined line, back down, and up again, until it is almost at the top. Another abruptly collides with it, and it moves back down. A third gently touches it and moves together with it to the top of the incline. It is impossible not to see the first dot as trying to get up the hill, the second as hindering it, and the third as helping it reach its goal. The social psychologists Fritz Heider and M. Simmel were the filmmakers. Together with many developmental psychologists, they conclude that people interpret certain motions not as special cases in their intuitive physics (perhaps as weird springy objects) but as a different kind of entity altogether. People construe certain objects as animate agents. Agents are recognized by their ability to violate intuitive', 'Even physics professors guess '),

Under polygyny, men vie for extraordinary Darwinian stakes many wives versus none and the competition is literally cutthroat. Many homicides and most tribal wars are directly or indirectly about competition for women. Leaders have outlawed polygyny when they needed less powerful men as allies and when they needed their subjects to fight an enemy instead of fighting one another. Early Christianity appealed to, poor men partly because the promise of monogamy kept them in the marriage game, and in societies since, egalitarianism and monogamy go together as naturally as despotism and polygyny. Even today, inequality has allowed a kind of polygyny to flourish. Wealthy men support a wife and a mistress, or divorce their wives at twenty-year intervals and pay them alimony and child support while marrying younger women. The journalist Robert Wright has speculated that easy divorce and remarriage, like overt polygyny, increases violence. Women of childbearing age are monopolized by well-to-do men, and the shortage of potential wives trickles down to the lower strata, forcing the poorest young men into desperate competition. Family Values 479 All of these intrigues come from a single difference between the sexes, mens greater desire for multiple partners. But men are not completely indiscriminate, and women are not voiceless in any but the most despotic societies. Each sex has criteria for picking partners for liaisons and for marriages. Like other staunch human tastes, they appear to be adaptations. Both sexes want spouses, and men want liaisons more than women do, but that does not mean women never want liaisons. If they never did want them, the male urge to philander could not have evolved because it would never have been rewarded (unless the philanderer could always trick his conquest into thinking he was courting her as a wife but even then, a married woman should never philander or be a target of philandering). Mens testicles would not have evolved to their larger-thangorilla proportions, for their sperm would never be in danger of being outnumbered. And jealous feelings directed at wives would not exist; as we shall see, they do exist. The ethnographic record shows that in all societies, both sexes commit adultery, and the women do not always take arsenic or throw themselves under the 5:02 from St. Petersburg. What could ancestral women have gained from liaisons that would have allowed the desire to evolve? One reward is resources. If men want sex for its own sake, women can make them pay for it.

If expressions appeared universal, it was thought, that was because Western models had become universal; no culture was beyond the reach of John Wayne and Charlie Chaplin. Ekman assembled photographs of people express366 ing six emotions. He showed them to people from many cultures, including the isolated Fore foragers of Papua New Guinea, and asked them to label the emotion or make up a story about what the person had gone through. Everyone recognized happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. For example, a Fore subject said that the American showing fear in the photograph must have just seen a boar. Reversing the procedure, Ekman photographed his Fore informants as they acted out scenarios such as Your friend has come and you are happy," "Your child has died," "You are angry and about to fight," and You see a dead pig that has been lying there for a long time." The expressions in the photographs are unmistakable. When Ekman began to present his findings at a meeting of anthropologists in the late 1960s, he met with outrage. One prominent anthropologist rose from the audience shouting that Ekman should not be allowed to continue to speak because his claims were fascist. On another occasion an African American activist called him a racist for saying that black facial expressions were no different from white ones. Ekman was bewildered because he had thought that if the work had any political moral it was unity and brotherhood. In any case, the conclusions have been replicated and are now widely accepted in some form (though there are controversies over which expressions belong on the universal list, how much context is needed to interpret them, and how reflexively they are tied to each emotion). And another observation by Darwin has been corroborated: children who are blind and deaf from birth display virtually the full gamut of emotions on their faces. Why, then, do so many people think that emotions differ from culture to culture? Their evidence is much more indirect than Darwins informants and Ekmans experiments. It comes from two sources that cannot be trusted at all as readouts of peoples minds: their language and their opinions. The common remark that a language does or doesnt have a wprd for an emotion means little. In The Language Instinct I argued that the influence of language on thought has been exaggerated, and that is all the more true for the influence of language on feeling. Whether a language appears to have a word for an emotion depends on the skill of the translator and on quirks of the languages grammar and history. A language accumulates a large vocabulary, including words for emotions, when it has had influential wordsmiths, contact with other languages, rules for forming new words out of old ones, and widespread literacy, which Hotheads 367 allows new coinages to become epidemic. When a language has not had these stimulants, people describe how they feel with circumlocutions, metaphors, metonyms, and synecdoches. When a Tahitian woman says, "My husband died and I feel sick," her emotional state is hardly mysterious; we can bet she is not complaining about acid indigestion. Even a language with a copious vocabulary has words for only a fraction of emotional experience. The author G. K.

With that advantage, genes for helping relatives will increase in a population over the generations. The vast majority of altruistic acts in the animal kingdom benefit the actors kin. The most extreme examples of kin-directed altruism are found among social insects like ants and bees, in which the workers give their all to the colony. They are permanently sterile and defend the colony with kamikaze tactics like blowing up to spray noxious chemicals on an invader or stinging it with a barbed stinger that pulls the insects body apart when dislodged. Such dedication comes largely from an unusual genetic system which makes them more closely related to their sisters than they would be to their offspring. By defending the colony they help their mothers make sisters instead of making offspring of their own. Genes cant call to one another or pull the strings of behavior directly. In humans, "kin altruism" and "benefiting ones genes" are shorthand for two collections of psychological machinery, one cognitive, one emotional. Humans are equipped with a desire and an ability to learn their family tree. Genealogy is a special kind of knowledge. First, the relationships are digital. Youre either someones mother or you arent. You might be eighty percent sure that Bill is Johns father, but that is not the same as thinking that Bill is eighty percent of a father to John. We speak of halfbrothers, but everyone knows the expression is shorthand for having the same mother and different fathers or vice versa. Second, kinship is a relation. No one is a father or a sister, period; they have to be the father or the sister of someone. Third, kinship is topological. Everyone is a node in a web whose links are defined by parenthood, generation, and gender. Kinship terms are logical expressions that are read off the geometry and labeling of the web: a "parallel cousin," for example, is ones fathers brothers child or ones mothers sisters child. Fourth, kinship is self-contained. Age, place of birth, acquaintanceship, status, occupation, zodiac sign, and all the other categories in which we place people lie in a different plane from the categories of kinship and need not be consulted when we calculate kinship. Homo sapiens is obsessed with kinship. All over the world, when people are asked to talk about themselves, they begin with their parentage and family ties, and in many societies, especially foraging groups, people rattle off endless genealogies. For adoptees, childhood refugees, or Family Values 431 descendants of slaves, curiosity about biological kin can drive a lifelong quest. (Entrepreneurs hope to exploit this motive when they send out those computer-generated postcards that offer to trace Steven Pinkers ancestors and find the Pinker family seal and coat of arms.) Of course, people ordinarily do not test each others DNA; they assess kinship by indirect means. Many animals do it by smell. Humans do it with several kinds of information: who grows up together, who resembles whom, how people interact, what reliable sources say, and what can be logically deduced from other kin relationships. Once we know how we are related to other people, the other component of the psychology of kinship kicks in. We feel a measure of solidarity, sympathy, tolerance, and trust toward our relatives, added on to whatever other feelings we may have for them.

My own conjecture is that todays slender centerfolds and supermodels would not have had trouble finding a date at any time in history, because they are not like the skinny women eschewed in centuries past. Body parts do not vary independently. Tall men tend to have big feet, people with thick waists tend to have double chins, and so on.

The really sexist societies drape women in chadors from head to foot. Throughout history the critics of beauty have been powerful men, religious leaders, sometimes older women, and doctors, who can always be counted on to say that the latest beauty craze is hazardous to womens health. The enthusiasts are women themselves. The explanation is simple economics and politics (though not the orthodox feminist analysis quite insulting to women, incidentally in which women are dupes who have been brainwashed into striving for something they dont want). Women in open societies want to look good because it gives them an edge in competing for husbands, status, and the attention of powerful people. Men in closed societies hate beauty because it makes their wives and daughters indiscriminately attractive to other men, giving the women a measure of control over the profits from their own sexuality and taking it away from the men (and, in the case of daughters, away from their mothers).

And that does not mean compensating for our slumming by dressing up the lowly subject matter in highfalutin "theory" (a semiotic analysis of Peanuts, a psychoanalytic exegesis of Archie Bunker, a deconstruction of Vogue). It means asking a simple question: What is it about the mind that lets people take pleasure in shapes and colors and sounds and jokes and stories and myths? That question might be answerable, whereas questions about art in general are not. Theories of art carry the seeds of their own destruction. In an age when any Joe can buy CDs, paintings, and novels, artists make their careers by finding ways to avoid the hackneyed, to challenge jaded tastes, to differentiate the cognoscenti from the dilettantes, and to flout the current wisdom about what art is (hence the fruitless attempts over the decades to define art). Any discussion that fails to recognize that dynamic is doomed to sterility. It can never explain why music pleases the ear, because "music" will be defined to encompass atonal jazz, chromatic compositions, and other intellectual exercises. It will never understand the bawdy laughs and convivial banter that are so important in peoples lives because it will define humor as the arch wit of an Oscar Wilde. Excellence and the avant-garde are designed for the sophisticated palate, a product of years of immersion in a genre and a familiarity with its conventions and cliches. They rely on one-upmanship and arcane 524 allusions and displays of virtuosity. However fascinating and worthy of our support they are, they tend to obscure the psychology of aesthetics, not to illuminate it. Another reason the psychology of the arts is obscure is that they are not adaptive in the biologists sense of the word. This book has been about the adaptive design of the major components of the mind, but that does not mean that I believe that everything the mind does is biologically adaptive. The mind is a neural computer, fitted by natural selection with combinatorial algorithms for causal and probabilistic reasoning about plants, animals, objects, and people. It is driven by goal states that served biological fitness in ancestral environments, such as food, sex, safety, parenthood, friendship, status, and knowledge. That toolbox, however, can be used to assemble Sunday afternoon projects of dubious adaptive value. Some parts of the mind register the attainment of increments of fitness by giving us a sensation of pleasure. Other parts use a knowledge of cause and effect to bring about goals. Put them together and you get a mind that rises to a biologically pointless challenge: figuring out how to get at the pleasure circuits of the brain and deliver little jolts of enjoyment without the inconvenience of wringing bona fide fitness increments from the harsh world. When a rat has access to a lever that sends electrical impulses to an electrode implanted in its medial forebrain bundle, it presses the lever furiously until it drops of exhaustion, forgoing opportunities to eat, drink, and have sex. People dont yet undergo elective neurosurgery to have electrodes implanted in their pleasure centers, but they have found ways to stimulate them by other means. An obvious example is recreational drugs, which seep into the chemical junctions of the pleasure circuits. Another route to the pleasure circuits is via the senses, which stimulate the circuits when they are in environments that would have led to fitness in past generations. Of course a fitness-promoting environment cannot announce itself directly. It gives off patterns of sounds, sights, smells, tastes, and feels that', 'fiction and paintings on '),
(416, 43, 8, 'finite inventory of mental tools And what about the genius? How can natural selection explain a Shakespeare, a Mozart, an Einstein, an Abdul-Jabbar? How would Jane Austen, Vincent van Gogh, or Thelonious Monk have earned their keep on the Pleistocene savanna? All of us are creative. Every time we stick a handy object under the leg of a wobbly table or think up a new way to bribe a child into his pajamas, we have used our faculties to create a novel outcome. But creative geniuses are distinguished not just by their extraordinary works but by their extraordinary way of working; they are not supposed to think like you and me. They burst on the scene as prodigies, enfants terrihles, young turks. They listen to their muse and defy the conventional wisdom. They work when the inspiration hits, and leap with insight while the rest of us plod in baby steps along well-worn paths. They put a problem aside and let it incubate in the unconscious; then, without warning, a bulb lights up and a fully formed solution presents itself. Aha! The genius leaves us with masterpieces, a legacy of the unrepressed creativity of the unconscious. Woody Allen captures the image in his hypothetical letters from Vincent van Gogh in the story "If the Impressionists Had Been Dentists." Vincent writes to his brother in anguish and despair, "Mrs. Sol Schwimmer is suing me because I made her bridge as I felt it and not to fit her ridiculous mouth! Thats right! I cant work to order like a common tradesman! I decided her bridge should be enormous and billowing, with wild, explosive teeth flaring up in every direction like fire! Now she is upset because it wont fit in her mouth!I tried forcing the false plate in but it sticks out like a star burst chandelier. Still, I find it beautiful." Good Ideas 361 The image came out of the Romantic movement two hundred years ago and is now firmly entrenched. Creativity consultants take millions of dollars from corporations for Dilbertesque workshops on brainstorming, lateral thinking, and flow from the right side of the brain, guaranteed to turn every manager into an Edison. Elaborate theories have been built to explain the uncanny problem-solving power of the dreamy unconscious. Like Alfred Russel Wallace, some have concluded that there can be no natural explanation. Mozarts manuscripts were said to have no corrections. The pieces must have come from the mind of God, who had chosen to express his voice through Mozart. Unfortunately, creative people are at their most creative when writing their autobiographies. Historians have scrutinized their diaries, notebooks, manuscripts, and correspondence looking for signs of the temperamental seer periodically struck by bolts from the unconscious. Alas, they have found that the creative genius is more Salieri than Amadeus. Geniuses are wonks. The typical genius pays dues for at least ten years before contributing anything of lasting value. (Mozart composed symphonies at eight, but they werent very good; his first masterwork came in the twelfth year of his career.) During the apprenticeship, geniuses immerse themselves in their genre. They absorb tens of thousands of problems and solutions, so no challenge is completely new and they can draw on a vast repertoire of motifs and strategies. They keep an eye on the competition and a finger to the wind, and are either discriminating or lucky in their choice of problems. (The unlucky ones, however talented, arent remembered as geniuses.) They are mindful of the esteem of others and of their place in history. (The physicist Richard Feynman wrote two books describing how', 'finite inventory of mental '),
(417, 44, 8, 'forming an interval with respect to C called the minor third, then in comparison with its major counterpart it tends to evoke a feeling of sadness, pain, or pathos. The minor seventh is another "blue note," which evokes a gentle melancholy or mournfulness. Other intervals give off feelings that have been described as stoic, yearning, needful, dignified, dissonant, triumphant, horrific, flawed, and determined. The feelings are evoked both when the notes are played in succession as part of a melody 532 and when they are played simultaneously as part of a chord or harmony. The emotional connotations of musical intervals are not exactly universal, because people need to be familiar with an idiom to experience them, but they are not arbitrary either. Infants as young as four months old prefer music with consonant intervals such as a major third to music with dissonant intervals such as a minor second. And to learn the more complex emotional colorings of music, people do not have to be conditioned Pavlov-style, say, by hearing intervals paired with joyful dr melancholy lyrics or by hearing them while in a joyful or a melancholy mood. A person merely has to listen to melodies in a particular idiom over time, absorbing the patterns and contrasts among the intervals, and the emotional connotations develop automatically. Those are the pitches; how are they strung into melodies? Jackendoff and Lerdahl show how melodies are formed by sequences of pitches that are organized in three different ways, all at the same time. Each pattern of organization is captured in a mental representation. Take the opening of Woody Guthries "This Land Is Your Land": This land is your land,this land is my land, from Ca-li- for- nia, to the New York Is-land i^4i>JJrirrTrrJJiffTrjJriJUJjNjsJJiffi The first representation is called a grouping structure. The listener feels that groups of notes hang together in motifs, which in turn are grouped into phrases, which are grouped into lines or sections, which are grouped into stanzas, movements, and pieces. This hierarchical tree is similar to the phrase structure of a sentence, and when the music has lyrics, the two partly line up. The grouping structure is shown here by the brackets beneath the music. The snatches of melody for "This land is your land" and for "this land is my land" are the smallest-sized chunks. When they are joined together, they form a larger chunk. That larger chunk is joined with the combined chunk "from California to the New York Island" into a still larger chunk, and so on. The second representation is a metrical structure, the repeating sequence of strong and weak beats that we count off as "ONE-two- THREE-four, ONE-two-THREE-four." The overall pattern is summed up in musical notation as the time signature, such as 4/4, and the major boundaries of the structure itself are demarcated by the vertical lines The Meaning of Life 533 separating the music into bars. Each bar contains four beats, allocated among the different notes, with the first beat getting the strongest emphasis, the third beat an intermediate emphasis, and the second and fourth beats remaining weak. The metrical structure in this example is illustrated by the columns of dots under the notes. Each column corresponds to one tick of a metronome. The more dots in a column, the stronger the accent on that note. The third representation is a reductional structure. It dissects the melody into essential parts and ornaments. The ornaments are stripped off and the essential parts further dissected into even more essential parts and ornaments on them. The reduction continues until the melody is reduced', 'forming an interval with '),
(418, 45, 8, 'from person to person and is largely inherited.) The psychologists David Myers and Ed Diener have found that about eighty percent of people in the industrialized world report that they are at least "fairly satisfied with life," and about thirty percent say they are "very happy." (As far as we can tell, the reports are sincere.) The percentages are the same for all ages, for both sexes, for blacks and 392 J whites, and over four decades of economic growth. As Myers and Diener remark, "Compared with 1957, Americans have twice as many cars per person plus microwave ovens, color TVs, VCRs, air conditioners, answering machines, and $12 billion worth of new brand-name athletic shoes a year. So, are Americans happier than they were in 1957? They are not." Within an industrialized country, money buys only a little happiness: the correlation between wealth and satisfaction is positive but small. Lottery winners, after their jolt of happiness has subsided, return to their former emotional state. On the brighter side, so do people who have suffered terrible losses, such as paraplegics and survivors of the Holocaust. These findings do not necessarily contradict the singer Sophie Tucker when she said, "I have been poor and I have been rich. Rich is better." In India and Bangladesh, wealth predicts happiness much better than it does in the West. Among twenty-four Western European and American nations, the higher the gross national product per capita, the happier the citizens (though there are many explanations). Myers and Diener point out that wealth is like health: not having it makes you miserable, but having it does not guarantee happiness. The tragedy of happiness has a third act. There are twice as many negative emotions (fear, grief, anxiety, and so on) as positive ones, and losses are more keenly felt than equivalent gains. The tennis star Jimmy Connors once summed up the human condition: "I hate to lose more than I like to win." The asymmetry has been confirmed in the lab by showing that people will take a bigger gamble to avoid a sure loss than to improve on a sure gain, and by showing that peoples mood plummets more when imagining a loss in their lives (for example, in course grades, or in relationships with the opposite sex) than it rises when imagining an equivalent gain. The psychologist Timothy Ketelaar notes that happiness tracks the effects of resources on biological fitness. As things get better, increases in fitness show diminishing returns: more food is better, but only up to a point. But as things get worse, decreases in fitness can take you out of the game: not enough food, and youre dead. There are many ways to become infinitely worse off (from an infection, starvation, getting eaten, a fall, ad infinitum) and not many ways to become vastly better off. That makes prospective losses more worthy of attention than gains; there are more things that make us unhappy than things that make us happy. Donald Campbell, an early evolutionary psychologist who studied the Hotheads 393 psychology of pleasure, described humans as being on a "hedonic treadmill," where gains in well-being leave us no happier in the long run. Indeed, the study of happiness often sounds like a sermon for traditional values. The numbers show that it is not the rich, privileged, robust, or good-looking who are happy; it is those who have spouses, friends, religion, and challenging, meaningful work. The findings can be overstated, because they apply to averages, not individuals, and because cause and effect are hard to tease apart: being married might make you happy, but', 'from person to person '),
(419, 46, 8, 'Genes can change the molecular locks and keys that encourage neurons to connect with other ones. As in the old joke about how to carve a statue of an elephant (remove all the bits that dont look like an elephant), neural circuits can be sculpted by programming certain cells and synapses to commit suicide on cue. Neurons can become active at different points in embryogenesis, and their firing patterns, both spontaneous and programmed, can be interpreted downstream as information about how to wire together. Many of these processes interact in cascades. For example, increasing the size of one area allows it to compete better for real estate downstream. Natural selection does not care how baroque the brain-assembly process is, or how ugly the resulting brain. Modifications are evaluated strictly on how well the brains algorithms work in guiding the perception, thought, and action of the whole animal. By these processes, natural selection can build a better and better functioning brain. But could the selection of random variants really improve the design of a nervous system? Or would the variants crash it, like a corrupted byte Revenge of the Nerds 177 in a computer program, and the selection merely preserve the systems that do not crash? A new field of computer science called genetic algorithms has shown that Darwinian selection can create increasingly intelligent software. Genetic algorithms are programs that are duplicated to make multiple copies, though with random mutations that make each one a tiny bit different. All the copies have a go at solving a problem, and the ones that do best are allowed to reproduce to furnish the copies for the next round. But first, parts of each program are randomly mutated again, and pairs of programs have sex: each is split in two, and the halves are exchanged. After many cycles of computation, selection, mutation, and reproduction, the surviving programs are often better than anything a human programmer could have designed. More apropos of how a mind can evolve, genetic algorithms have been applied to neural networks. A network might be given inputs from simulated sense organs and outputs to simulated legs and placed in a virtual environment with scattered "food" and many other networks competing for it. The ones that get the most food leave the most copies before the next round of mutation and selection. The mutations are random changes in the connection weights, sometimes followed by sexual recombination between networks (swapping some of their connection weights). During the early iterations, the "animals" or, as they are sometimes called, "animats" wander randomly over the terrain, occasionally bumping into a food source. But as they evolve they come to zip directly from food source to food source. Indeed, a population of networks that is allowed to evolve innate connection weights often does better than a single neural network that is allowed to learn them. That is especially true for networks with multiple hidden layers, which complex animals, especially humans, surely have. If a network can only learn, not evolve, the environmental teaching signal gets diluted as it is propagated backward to the hidden layers and can only nudge the connection weights up and down by minuscule amounts. But if a population of networks can evolve, even if they cannot learn, mutations and recombinations can reprogram the hidden layers directly, and can catapult the network into a combination of innate connections that is much closer to the optimum. Innate structure is selected for. Evolution and learning can also go on simultaneously, with innate structure evolving in an animal that also learns. A population of networks can be equipped', 'Genes can change the '),
(420, 47, 8, 'Grant. Darwin was inspired to the theory of natural selection in part by the thirteen species of finches on the Galapagos islands. They clearly were related to a species on the South American mainland, but differed from tlhem and Revenge of the Nerds 163 from one another. In particular, their beaks resembled different kinds of pliers: heavy-duty linemans pliers, high-leverage diagonal pliers, straight needle-nose pliers, curved needle-nose pliers, and so on. Darwin eventually reasoned that one kind of bird was blown to the islands and then differentiated into the thirteen species because of the demands of different ways of life on different parts of the islands, such as stripping bark from trees to get at insects, probing cactus flowers, or cracking tough seeds. But he despaired of ever seeing natural selection happen in real time: "We see nothing of these slow changes in progress, until the hand of time has marked the lapse of ages." The Grants painstakingly measured the size and toughness of the seeds in different parts of the Galapagos at different times of the year, the length of the finches beaks, the time they took to crack the seeds, the numbers and ages of the finches in different parts of the islands, and so on every variable relevant to natural selection. Their measurements showed the beaks evolving to track changes in the availability of different kinds of seeds, a frame-by-frame analysis of the movie that Darwin could only imagine. Selection in action is even more dramatic among faster-breeding organisms, as the world is discovering to its peril in the case of pesticide-resistant insects, drug-resistant bacteria, and the AIDS virus in a single patient. And two of the prerequisites of natural selection enough variation and enough time are there for the having. Populations of naturally living organisms maintain an enormous reservoir of genetic variation that can serve as the raw material for natural selection. And life has had more than three billion years to evolve on earth, complex life a billion years, according to a recent estimate. In The Ascent of Man, Jacob Bronowski wrote: I remember as a young father tiptoeing to the cradle of my first daughter when she was four or five days old, and thinking, "These marvelous fingers, every joint so perfect, down to the fingernails. I could not have designed that detail in a million years." But of course it is exactly a million years that it took me, a million years that it took mankindto reach its present stage of evolution. Finally, two kinds of formal modeling have shown that natural selection can work. Mathematical proofs from population genetics show how genes combining according to Gregor Mendels laws can change in frequency under the pressure of selection. These changes can occur impressively fast. If a mutant produces just 1 percent more offspring 164 J than its rivals, it can increase its representation in a population from 0.1 percent to 99.9 percent in just over four thousand generations, A hypothetical mouse subjected to a selection pressure for increased size that is so weak it cannot be measured could nonetheless evolve to the $ize of an elephant in only twelve thousand generations. More recently, computer simulations from the new field of Artificial Life have shown the power of natural selection to evolve organisms with complex adaptations. And what better demonstration than everyones favorite example of a complex adaptation, the eye?

When standard logic and cheater-detector logic coincide, people act like logicians; when they part company, people still look for cheaters. What gave Cosmides the idea to look for this mental mechanism? It was the evolutionary analysis of altruism (see Chapters 6 and 7). Natural selection does not select public-mindedness; a selfish mutant would quickly outreproduce its altruistic competitors. Any selfless behavior in the natural world needs a special explanation. One explanation is reciprocation: a creature can extend help in return for help expected in the future. But favor-trading is always vulnerable to cheaters. For it to have evolved, it must be accompanied by a cognitive apparatus that remembers who has taken and that ensures that they give in return. The evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers had predicted that humans, the most conspicuous altruists in the animal kingdom, should have evolved a hypertrophied cheater-detector algorithm. Cosmides appears to have found it. L338 I So is the mind logical in the logicians sense? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. A better question is, Is the mind well-designed in the biologists sense? Here the "yes" can be a bit stronger. Logic by itself can spin off trivial truths and miss consequential ones. The mind does seem to use logical rules, but they are recruited by the processes of language understanding, mixed with world knowledge, and supplemented or superseded by special inference rules appropriate to the content. Mathematics is part of our birthright. One-week-old babies perk up when a scene changes from two to three items or vice versa. Infants in their first ten months notice how many items (up to four) are in a display, and it doesnt matter whether the items are homogeneous or heterogeneous, bunched together or spread out, dots or household objects, even whether they are objects or sounds. According to recent experiments by the psychologist Karen Wynn, five-month-old infants even do simple arithmetic. They are shown Mickey Mouse, a screen covers him up, and a second Mickey is placed behind it. The babies expect to see two Mickeys when the screen falls and are surprised if it reveals only one. Other babies are shown two Mickeys and one is removed from behind the screen. These babies expect to see one Mickey and are surprised to find two. By eighteen months children know that numbers not only differ but fall into an order; for example, the children can be taught to choose the picture with fewer dots. Some of these abilities are found in, or can be taught to, some kinds of animals. Can infants and animals really count? The question may sound absurd because these creatures have no words. But registering quantities does not depend on language. Imagine opening a faucet for one second every time you hear a drumbeat. The amount of water in the glass would represent the number of beats. The brain might have a similar mechanism, which would accumulate not water but neural pulses or the number of active neurons. Infants and many animals appear to be equipped with this simple kind of counter. It would have many potential selective advantages, which depend on the animals niche. They range from estimating the rate of return of foraging in different patches to solving problems such as "Three bears went into the cave; two came out. Should I go in?" r Good Ideas 339 Human adults use several mental representations of quantity.

His chief occupation is extermination of other animals and his own species, which, however, multiplies with such insistent rapidity as to infest the whole habitable earth and Canada. Homo sapiens sapiens is indeed an unprecedented animal, with many zoologically unique or extreme traits. Humans achieve their goals by complex chains of behavior, assembled on the spot and tailored to the situation. They plan the behavior using cognitive models of the causal structure of the world. They learn these models in their lifetimes and communicate them through language, which allows the knowledge to accumulate within a group and over generations. They manufacture and depend upon many kinds of tools. They exchange goods and favors over long periods of time. Food is transported long distances, processed extensively, stored, and shared. Labor is divided between the sexes. Humans form large, structured coalitions, especially among males, and coalitions wage war against each other. Humans use fire. Kinship systems are complex and vary with other aspects of their lifestyles. Mating relations are negotiated by kin, often by groups exchanging daughters. Ovulation is concealed, and females may choose to have sex at any time rather than at certain points in a reproductive cycle. A few of these traits are found among some of the great apes, but to a much lesser degree, and most are not found at all. And humans have rediscovered traits that are rare among primates but found in other aniRevenge of the Nerds 187 mals. They are bipedal. They live longer than other apes, and bear helpless offspring who stay children (that is, sexually immature) for a substantial part of their lives. Hunting is important, and meat a large part of the diet. Males invest in their offspring: they tote children around, protect them against animals and other humans, and give them food. And as The Devils Dictionary points out, humans occupy every ecozone on earth. Aside from the retooling of the skeleton that gives us upright posture and precision manipulation, what makes us unusual is not our body but our behavior and the mental programs that organize it. In the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes, Calvin asks his tiger companion why people are never content with what they have. Hobbes replies, "Are you kidding? Your fingernails are a joke, youve got no fangs, you cant see at night, your pink hides are ridiculous, your reflexes are nil, and you dont even have tails! Of course people arent content!" But despite these handicaps, humans control the fate of tigers, rather than vice versa. Human evolution is the original revenge of the nerds. Perhaps recoiling from the image of the pasty-faced, pocket-protected, polyester-clad misfits, theorists on human evolution have looked far and wide for alternative theories. Human ingenuity has been explained away as a by-product of blood vessels in the skull that radiate heat, as a runaway courtship device like the peacocks tail, as a stretching of chimpanzee childhood, and as an escape hatch that saved the species from the evolutionary dead end of bearing fewer and fewer offspring. Even in theories that acknowledge that intelligence itself was selected for, the causes are badly underpowered in comparison with the effects. In various stories the full human mind sprang into existence to solve narrow problems like chipping tools out of stone, cracking open nuts and bones, throwing rocks at animals, keeping track of toddlers, following herds to scavenge their dead, and maintaining social bonds in a large group.

Partners in crime are held in separate cells, and the prosecutor offers each one a deal. If you rat on your partner and he stays mum, you go free and he gets ten years. If you both stay mum, you both get six months. If you both rat, you both get five years. The partners cannot communicate, and neither knows what the other will do. Each one thinks: If my partner rats and I stay mum, Ill do ten years; if he rats and I rat, too, Ill do five years. If he stays mum and I stay mum, Ill do six months; if he stays mum and I rat, Ill go free. Regardless of what he does, then, Im better off betraying him. Each is compelled to turn in his partner, and they both serve five years far worse than if each had trusted the other. But neither could take the chance because of the punishment he would incur if the other didnt. Social psychologists, mathematicians, economists, moral philosophers, and nuclear strategists have fretted over the paradox for decades. There is no solution. Real life, however, is not a Prisoners Dilemma in one respect. The mythical prisoners are placed in their dilemma once. Real people face each other in dilemmas of cooperation again and again, and can remember past treacheries or good turns and play accordingly. They can feel sympathetic and extend good will, feel aggrieved and seek revenge, feel grateful and return a favor, or feel remorseful and make amends. Recall that Trivers proposed that the emotions making up the moral sense could evolve when parties interacted repeatedly and could reward cooperation now with cooperation later and punish defection now with defection later. Robert Axelrod and William Hamilton confirmed the conjecture in a round-robin computer tournament that pitted different strategies for playing a repeated Prisoners Dilemma game against each other. They 504 stripped the dilemma to its essentials and awarded points to a strategy for the equivalent of minimizing jail time. A simple strategy called tit-fortat cooperate on the first move, and then do what your partner did on the move before beat sixty-two other strategies. Then they ran an artificial life simulation in which each strategy "reproduced" in proportion to its winnings and a new round-robin took place among the copies of the strategies. They repeated the process for many generations and found that the Tit for Tat strategy took over the population. Cooperativeness can evolve when the parties interact repeatedly, remember each others behavior, and reciprocate it. As we saw in Chapters 5 and 6, people are good at detecting cheaters and are fitted with moralistic emotions that prompt them to punish the cheaters and reward the cooperators. Does that mean that tit-for-tat underlies the widespread cooperation we find in the human species? It certainly underlies much of the cooperation we find in our society. Cashregister tapes, punch clocks, train tickets, receipts, accounting ledgers, and the other accoutrements of transactions that do not rely on the "honor system" are mechanical cheater-detectors. The cheaters, such as thieving employees, are sometimes charged with crimes, but more often they are simply cut off from further reciprocation, that is, fired. Similarly, the businesses that cheat their customers soon lose them. Footloose job applicants, fly-by-night businesses, and strangers calling with "investment opportunities" are often discriminated against because they look like they are playing a one-shot rather than an iterated game of cooperation,', 'I may be discouraged '),

None of our rationalizations makes sense. You say that insects are contaminated because they touch feces or garbage? But many insects are quite sanitary. Termites, for example, just munch wood, but Westerners feel no better about eating them.

Insects have indigestible wings and legs? Pull them off, as you do with peel-andeat shrimp, or stick to grubs and maggots. Insects taste bad? Here is a report from a British entomologist who was studying Laotian foodways and acquired a firsthand knowledge of his subject matter: None distasteful, a few quite palatable, notably the giant waterbug. For the most part they were insipid, with a faint vegetable flavour, but would not anyone tasting bread, for instance, for the first time, wonder why we eat such a flavourless food? A toasted dungbeetle or soft-bodied spider has a nice crisp exterior and soft interior of souffle consistency which is by no means unpleasant. Salt is usually added, sometimes chili or the leaves of scented herbs, and sometimes they are eaten with rice or added to sauces or curry. Flavour is exceptionally hard to define, but lettuce would, I think, best describe the taste of termites, cicadas, and crickets; lettuce and raw potato that of the giant Nephila spider, and concentrated Gorgonzola cheese that of the giant waterbug (Lethocems indicus). I suffered no ill effects from the eating of these insects. The psychologist Paul Rozin has masterfully captured the psychology of disgust. Disgust is a fear of incorporating an offending substance into ones body. Eating is the most direct way to incorporate a substance, and as my camp song shows, it is the most horrific thought that a disgusting substance can arouse. Smelling or touching it is also unappealing. Disgust deters people from eating certain things, or, if its too late, makes them spit or vomit them out. The facial expression says it all: the nose is wrinkled, constricting the nostrils, and the mouth is opened and the tongue pushed forward as if to squeegee offending material out. 380 Disgusting things come from animals. They include whole animals, parts of animals (particularly parts of carnivores and scavengers), and body products, especially viscous substances like mucus and pus and, most of all, feces, universally considered disgusting. Decaying animals and their parts are particularly revolting. In contrast, plants are sometimes distasteful, but distaste is different from disgust. When people avoid plant products say, lima beans or broccoli it is because they taste bitter or pungent. Unlike disgusting animal products, they are not felt to be unspeakably vile and polluting.

The statements that I am more likely to lose a fight against Mike Tyson than to win one, or that I am not likely to be abducted by aliens tonight, are not meaningless. But they are not mathematical statements that are precisely true or false, and people who question them have not committed an elementary fallacy. Statements about single events cant be decided by a calculator; they have to be hashed out by weighing the evidence, evaluating the persuasiveness of arguments, recasting the statements to make them easier to evaluate, and all the other fallible processes by which mortal beings make inductive guesses about an unknowable future. So even the ditziest performance in the Homo sapiens hall of shame saying that Linda is more likely to be a feminist bankteller than a bankteller is not a fallacy, according to many mathematicians. Since a single-event probability is mathematically meaningless, people are forced to make sense of the question as best they can. Gigeirenzer suggests that since frequencies are moot and people dont intuitively Good Ideas 351 give numbers to single events, they may switch to a third, nonmathematical definition of probability, "degree of belief warranted by the information just presented." That definition is found in many dictionaries and is used in courts of law, where it corresponds to concepts such as probable cause, weight of evidence, and reasonable doubt. If questions about single-event probabilities nudge people into that definition a natural interpretation for subjects to have made if they assumed, quite reasonably, that the experimenter had included the sketch of Linda for some purpose they would have interpreted the question as, To what extent does the information given about Linda warrant the conclusion that she is a bankteller? And a reasonable answer is, not very much. A final mind-bending ingredient of the concept of probability is the belief in a stable world. A probabilistic inference is a prediction today based on frequencies gathered yesterday. But that was then; this is now. How do you know that the world hasnt changed in the interim? Philosophers of probability debate whether any beliefs in probabilities are truly rational in a changing world. Actuaries and insurance companies worry even more insurance companies go bankrupt when a current event or a change in lifestyles makes their tables obsolete. Social psychologists point to the schlemiel who avoids buying a car with excellent repair statistics after hearing that a neighbors model broke down yesterday. Gigerenzer offers the comparison of a person who avoids letting his child play in a river with no previous fatalities after hearing that a neighbors child was attacked there by a crocodile that morning. The difference between the scenarios (aside from the drastic consequences) is that we judge that the car world is stable, so the old statistics apply, but the river world has changed, so the old statistics are moot. The person in the street who gives a recent anecdote greater weight than a ream of statistics is not necessarily being irrational. Of course, people sometimes reason fallaciously, especially in todays data deluge. And, of course, everyone should learn probability and statistics. But a species', 'In a letter to '),

And those are precisely the goals that drive the human organisms in fiction. Most of the thirtysix plots in Georges Poltis catalogue are defined by love or sex or a threat to the safety of the protagonist or his kin (for example, "Mistaken jealousy," "Vengeance taken for kindred upon kindred," and "Discovery of the dishonor of a loved one"). The difference between fiction for chil542 dren and fiction for adults is commonly summed up in two words: sex and violence. Woody Allens homage to Russian literature was entitled Love and Death. Pauline Kael got the title for one of her books of movie criticism from an Italian movie poster that she said contained "the briefest statement imaginable of the basic appeal of the movies": Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Sex and violence are not just the obsessions of pulp fiction and trash TV. The language maven Richard Lederer and the computer programmer Michael Gilleland present the following tabloid headlines: CHICAGO CHAUFFEUR SMOTHERS BOSSS DAUGHTER, THEN CUTS HER UP AND STUFFS HER IN FURNACE DOCTORS WIFE AND LOCAL MINISTER EXPOSED FOR CONCEIVING ILLEGITIMATE DAUGHTER TEENAGERS COMMIT DOUBLE SUICIDE; FAMILIES VOW TO END VENDETTA STUDENT CONFESSES TO AXE MURDER OF LOCAL PAWNBROKER AND ASSISTANT GARAGE OWNER STALKS AFFLUENT BUSINESSMAN, THEN SHOTGUNS HIM IN HIS SWIMMING POOL MADWOMAN LONG IMPRISONED IN ATTIC SETS HOUSE ON FIRE, THEN LEAPS TO DEATH FORMER SCHOOLTEACHER, FOUND TO HAVE BEEN PROSTITUTE, COMMITTED TO INSANE ASYLUM PRINCE ACQUITTED OF KILLING MOTHER IN REVENGE FOR MURDER OF HIS FATHER Sound familiar? See the endnotes. Fiction is especially compelling when the obstacles to the protagonists goals are other people in pursuit of incompatible goals. Life is like chess, and plots are like those books of famous chess games that serious players study so they will be prepared if they ever find themselves in similar straits. The books are handy because chess is combinatorial; at any stage there are too many possible sequences of moves and countermoves for them all to be played out in ones mind. General strategies like "Get your Queen out early" are too vague to be of much use, given the trillions The Meaning of Life 543 of situations the rules permit. A good training regime is to build up a mental catalogue of tens of thousands of game challenges and the moves that allowed good players to do well in them. In artificial intelligence, it is called case-based reasoning. Life has even more moves than chess. People are always, to some extent, in conflict, and their moves and countermoves multiply out to an unimaginably vast set of interactions. Partners, like the prisoners in the hypothetical dilemma, can either cooperate or defect, on this move and on subsequent moves. Parents, offspring, and siblings, because of their partial genetic overlap, have both common and competing interests, and any deed that one party directs toward another may be selfless, selfish, or a mixture of the two. When boy meets girl, either or both may see the other as a spouse, as a one-night stand, or neither. Spouses may be faithful or adulterous. Friends may be false friends. Allies may assume less than their fair share of the risk, or may defect as the finger of fate turns toward them. Strangers may be competitors or outright enemies.

And since computation itself takes time, information processing can be part of the problem rather than part of the solution. Think about a hiker planning the quickest route back to camp before it gets dark and taking twenty minutes to plot out a path that saves her ten minutes. A third cost is resources. Information processing requires energy. That is obvious to anyone who has stretched out the battery life of a laptop computer by slowing down the processor and restricting its access to information on the disk. Thinking, too, is expensive. The technique of functional imaging of brain activity (PET and MRI) depends on the fact that working brain tissue calls more blood its way and consumes more glucose. Any intelligent agent incarnated in matter, working in real time, and subject to the laws of thermodynamics must be restricted in its access to information. Only information relevant to the problem at hand should be allowed in. That does not mean that the agent should wear blinkers or become an amnesiac. Information that is irrelevant at one time for one purpose might be relevant at another time for another purpose. So information must be routed. Information that is always irrelevant to a kind of computation should be permanently sealed off from it. Information that is sometimes relevant and sometimes irrelevant should be accessible to a computation when it is relevant, insofar as that can be predicted in advance. This design specification explains why access-consciousness exists in the human mind and also allows us to understand some of its details. Access-consciousness has four obvious features. First, we are aware, to varying degrees, of a rich field of sensation: the colors and Thinking Machines 139 shapes of the world in front of us, the sounds and smells we are bathed in, the pressures and aches of our skin, bone, and muscles. Second, portions of this information can fall under the spotlight of attention, get rotated into and out of short-term memory, and feed our deliberative cogitation. Third, sensations and thoughts come with an emotional flavoring: pleasant or unpleasant, interesting or repellent, exciting or soothing. Finally, an executive, the "I," appears to make choices and pull the levers of behavior. Each of these features discards some information in the nervous system, defining the highways of access-consciousness. And each has a clear role in the adaptive organization of thought and perception to serve rational decision making and action. Lets begin with the perceptual field. Jackendoff, after reviewing the levels of mental representation used by various modules, asked which level corresponds to the rich field of present-tense awareness. For example, visual processing runs from the rods and cones in the retina, through intermediate levels representing edges, depths, and surfaces, to a recognition of the objects in front of us. Language understanding proceeds from raw sound up through representations of syllables, words, and phrases, to an understanding of the content of the message. ( Jackendoff observed that access-consciousness seems to tap the intermediate levels. People are unaware of the lowest levels of sensation. We do not spend our lives in Proustian contemplation of every crumb of the madeleine and every nuance of the decoction of lime flowers. We literally cannot see the lightness of the coal in the sun, the darkness of the snowball inside, the pale green-gray of the "black" areas on the television screen, or the rubbery parallelograms that a moving square projects on our retinas.

Of course cultural evolution is not an exact replica of the Darwinian version. In cultural evolution, the mutations are directed and the acquired characteristics are inherited. Lamarck, while being wrong about biological evolution, turned out to be right about cultural evolution. But this wont do. Lamarck, recall, was not just unlucky in his guess about life on this planet. As far as explaining complex design goes, his theory was, and is, a non-starter. It is mute about the beneficent force in the universe or all-knowing voice in the organism that bestows the useful mutations. And its that force or voice thats doing all the creative work. To say that cultural evolution is Lamarckian is to confess that one has no idea how it works. The striking features of cultural products, namely their ingenuity, beauty, and truth (analogous to organisms complex adaptive design), come from the mental computations that "direct" that is, invent the "mutations," and that "acquire" that is, understand the "characteristics." Models of cultural transmission do offer insight on other features of 210 I cultural change, particularly their demographics how memes can become popular or unpopular. But the analogy is more from epidemiology than from evolution: ideas as contagious diseases that caluse epidemics, rather than as advantageous genes that cause adaptations. They explain how ideas become popular, but not where ideas come from. Many people unfamiliar with cognitive science see cultural Evolution as the only hope for grounding wispy notions like ideas and culture in rigorous evolutionary biology. To bring culture into biology, they reason, one shows how it evolved by its own version of natural selection. But that is a non sequitur; the products of evolution dont have to look like evolution. The stomach is firmly grounded in biology, but it does not randomly secrete variants of acids and enzymes, retain the ones that break down food a bit, let them sexually recombine and reproduce, and so on for hundreds of thousands of meals. Natural selection already went through such trial and error in designing the stomach, and now the stomach is an efficient chemical processor, releasing the right acids and enzymes on cue. Likewise, a group of minds does not have to recapitulate the process of natural selection to come up with a good idea. Natural selection designed the mind to be an information processor, and now it perceives, imagines, simulates, and plans. When ideas are passed around, they arent merely copied with occasional typographical errors; they are evaluated, discussed, improved on, or rejected. Indeed, a mind that passively accepted ambient memes would be a sitting duck for exploitation by others and would have quickly been selected against. The geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky famously wrote that nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution. We can add that nothing in culture makes sense except in the light of psychology. Evolution created psychology, and that is how it explains culture. The most important relic of early humans is the modern mind. 4 THE MINDS EYE To gaze is to think. SALVADOR DALI Past decades had hula hoops, black-light posters, CB radios, and Rubiks cube.

But one, in Zaire, contains finely crafted bone implements including daggers, shafts, and barbed points, together with grindstones brought from miles away and the remains of thousands of catfish, presumably the victims of these instruments. The collection looks postrevolutionary but is dated at 75,000 years ago. One commenta204 J tor said it was like finding a Pontiac in Leonardo da Vincis attic. But as archeologists are starting to explore this continental attic and date its contents, they are finding more and more Pontiacs: fine stone blades, decorated tools, useless but colorful minerals transported hundreds of miles. Third, the mitochondrial Eve of 200,000 to 100,000 years ago was not a party to any evolutionary event. Contrary to some fantastic misunderstandings, she did not undergo some mutation that left her descendants smarter or more talkative or less brutish. Nor did she mark the end of human evolution. She is merely a mathematical necessity: the most recent common ancestor of all living people along the female-femalefemale line of great-great-. . .-great-grandmothers. For all the definition says, Eve could have been a fish. Eve, of course, turned out to be not a fish but an African hominid. Why would anyone assume that she was a special hominid, or even that she lived in special times? One reason is that she made many other times and places non-special. If twentieth-century Europeans and Asians mDNA is a variant of 200,000-year-old African mDNA, they must be descendants of an African population at the time. Eves contemporary Europeans and Asians left no mDNA in todays Europeans and Asians, and thus presumably were not their ancestors (at least and this is a big proviso not their all-maternal-line ancestors). But that says nothing about evolutions having stopped with Eve. We can assume that most evolution was done with by the time the ancestors of the modern races separated and stopped exchanging genes, since today we are birds of a feather. But that did not happen as soon as Eve breathed her last. The diaspora of the races, and the end of significant human evolution, must have occurred much later. Eve is not Our most recent common ancestor, only our most recent common ancestor in the all-maternal line. The most recent common ancestor along a mixed-sex line of descendants lived much later. You and a first cousin share an ancestor of just two generations ago, your common grandmother or grandfather. But in looking for a shared all-female-line ancestor (your mothers mothers mother, and so on), then except for one kind of cousin (the child of your mothers sister), theres almost no limit to how far back you might have to go. So if someone were to guess the degree of relatedness between you and your cousin based on your most recent ancestor, he would say you were closely related. But if he could check only the most recent all-female-line ancestor, he might guess that you are not Revenge of the Nerds 205 related at all! Similarly, the birthday of humanitys most recent common all-female-line ancestor, mitochondrial Eve, overestimates how long ago all of humanity was still interbreeding. Well after Eves day, some geneticists think, our ancestors passed through a population bottleneck. According to their scenario, which is based on the remarkable sameness of genes across modern human populations, around 65,000 years ago our ancestors dwindled to a mere ten thousand people, perhaps because of a global cooling triggered by a volcano in Sumatra.

Derek Freeman and other anthropologists found that Samoan society in fact had widespread adolescent resentment and delinquency, a cult of virginity, frequent rape, reprisals by the rape victims family, frigidity, harsh punishment of children, sexual jealousy, and strong religious feeling. We should not be surprised at these discrepancies. The anthropologist Renato Rosaldo has noted, "A traditional anthropological description is like a book of etiquette. What you get isnt so much the deep cultural wisdom as the cultural cliches, the wisdom of Polonius, conventions in Hotheads 369 the trivial rather than the informing sense. It may tell you the official rules, but it wont tell you how life is lived." Emotions, in particular, are often regulated by the official rules, because they are assertions of a persons interests. To me its a confession of my innermost feelings, but to you its bitching and moaning, and you may very well tell me to put a lid on it. And to those in power, other peoples emotions are even more annoying they lead to nuisances such as women wanting men as husbands and sons rather than as cannon fodder, men fighting each other when they could be fighting the enemy, and children falling in love with a soulmate instead of accepting a betrothed who cements an important deal. Many societies deal with these nuisances by trying to regulate emotions and spreading the disinformation that they dont exist. Ekman has shown that cultures differ the most in how the emotions are expressed in public. He secretly filmed the expressions of American and Japanese students as they watched gruesome footage of a primitive puberty rite. (Emotion researchers have extensive collections of grossout material.) If a white-coated experimenter was in the room interviewing them, the Japanese students smiled politely during scenes that made the Americans recoil in horror. But when the subjects were alone, the Japanese and American faces were equally horrified. FEELING MACHINES The Romantic movement in philosophy, literature, and art began about two hundred years ago, and since then the emotions and the intellect have been assigned to different realms. The emotions come from nature and live in the body. They are hot, irrational impulses and intuitions, which follow the imperatives of biology. The intellect comes from civilization and lives in the mind. It is a cool deliberator that follows the interests of self and society by keeping the emotions in check. Romantics believe that the emotions are the source of wisdom, innocence, authenticity, and creativity, and should not be repressed by individuals or society. Often Romantics acknowledge a dark side, the price we must pay for artistic greatness. When the antihero in Anthony BurgessA Clockwork Orange has his violent impulses conditioned out of him, he loses his taste for Beethoven. Romanticism dominates contemporary American popular culture, as in the Dionysian ethos of rock music, the 370 J pop psychology imperative to get in touch with your feelings, and the Hollywood formulas about wise simpletons and about uptight yuppies taking a walk on the wild side. Most scientists tacitly accept the premises of Romanticism even when they disagree with its morals. The irrational emotions and the repressing intellect keep reappearing in scientific guises: the id and the superego, biological drives and cultural norms, the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere, the limbic system and the cerebral cortex, the evolutionary baggage of our animal ancestors and the general intelligence', 'incredible claim that Samoans '),

The belief is widespread. Every psychologist who has written about the function of the social emotions has talked about their benefit to the group. When people say that animals act for the good of the group, they seem not to realize that the assumption is in fact a radical departure from Darwinism and almost certainly wrong. Darwin wrote, "Natural selection will never produce in a being any structure more injurious than beneficial to that being, for natural selection acts solely by and for the good of each." Natural selection could select groups with selfless members only if each group could enforce a pact guaranteeing that all their members stayed selfless. But without enforcement, nothing could prevent a mutant or immigrant lemming from thinking, in effect, "To heck with this! Ill let everyone else jump off the cliff, and then enjoy the food they leave behind." The selfish lemming would reap the rewards of the others selflessness without paying any costs himself. With that advantage, his descendants would quickly take over the population, even if the population as a whole was worse off. And that is the fate of any tendency toward sacrifice. Natural selection is the cumulative effect of the relative successes of different replicators. That means that it selects for the replicators that replicate best, namely, the selfish ones. The inescapable fact that adaptations benefit the replicator was first articulated by the biologist George Williams and later amplified by Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene. Almost all evolutionary biologists now accept the point, though there are debates over other issues. Selection among groups is possible on paper, but most biologists doubt that the special circumstances that let it happen are ever found in the real 398 J world. Selection among branches of the tree of life is possible, but that has nothing to do with whether organisms are designed for unselfishness. Animals just dont care what happens to their group, species, or ecosystem. Wolves catch the old and weak deer because they are the easiest to catch. Hungry lemmings set out for better feeding grounds and sometimes fall or drown by accident, not suicide. Stags fight because each wants to breed, and one concedes when defeat is inevitable, or as part of a strategy that works on average against others playing the same strategy. Males who fight are wasteful to the group indeed, males in general are wasteful to the group when they make up half of it, because a few studs could sire the next generation without eating half the food. Biologists often describe these acts as self-interested behavior, but what causes behavior is the activity of the brain, especially the circuitry for emotions and other feelings. Animals behave selfishly because of how their emotion circuits are wired. My full stomach, my warmth, my orgasms, feel better to me than yours do, and I want mine, and will seek mine, more than yours. Of course, one animal cannot directly feel whats in another ones stomach, but it could feel it indirectly by observing the second animals behavior. So it is an interesting psychological fact that animals usually dont experience other animals observable well-being as their own pleasure. It is an even more interesting fact that they sometimes do. Earlier I said that natural selection selects selfish replicators. If organisms were replicators, all organisms should be selfish. But organisms do not replicate.

In a separate part of the system lies a larger repository of information, a long-term memory, that cannot be read by the demons until pieces of it are copied to the short-term memory. Many cognitive psychologists have pointed out that in these models the short-term memory (communal bulletin board, global workspace) acts just like consciousness. When we are aware of a piece of information, many parts of the mind can act on it. We not only see a ruler in front of us but can describe it, reach for it, deduce that it can prop up a window, or count its markings. As the philosopher Stephen Stich has put it, conscious information is inferentially promiscuous; it makes itself available to a large number of information- processing agents rather than committing itself to one alone. Newell and Simon have made headway in understanding human problem-solving simply by asking a person to think aloud when working on a puzzle. They have nicely simulated the mental activity using a production system where the contents of the bulletin board correspond step for step with the persons report of what he is consciously thinking. The engineering specs of information access, and thus the selection pressures that probably gave rise to it, are also becoming clearer. The general principle is that any information processor must be given limited access to information because information has costs as well as benefits. One cost is space: the hardware to hold the information. The limitation is all too clear to microcomputer owners deciding whether to invest in more RAM. Of course the brain, unlike a computer, comes with vast amounts of parallel hardware for storage. Sometimes theorists inferjirat the brain can store all contingencies in advance and that thougjafcan be reduced to one-step pattern recognition.

For example, there are thirty to^flrty-five possible moves at each point in a chess game, each of wj*fcn can be followed by thirty to thirty-five responses, defining about a thousand complete turns. A typical chess game lasts fortvKfrns, yielding 10120 different chess games. There are about 1070 Mtfficles in the visible universe. So no one can play chess by memorising all the games and recognizing every sequence of moves. The samgfs true for sentences, stories, melodies, and so on. Of course, some combinations can be stored, but pretty soon either you run out of brain 138 or you start to superimpose the patterns and get useless chimeras and blends. Rather than storing googols of inputs and their outputs or questions and their answers, an information processor needs rules:or algorithms that operate on a subset of information at a time and calculate an answer just when it is needed. A second cost of information is time. Just as one couldnt store all the chess games in a brain less than the size of the universe, one cant mentally play out all the chess games in a lifetime less than the age of the universe (1018 seconds).

Continuing this line of thought, we might observe that the more stable notes in a scale correspond to the lower and typically louder overtones emanating from a single soundmaker, and can confidently be grouped with the soundmakers fundamental frequency, the reference note. The less stable notes correspond to the higher and typically weaker overtones, and though they may have come from the same soundmaker as the reference note, the assignment is less secure. Similarly, notes separated by a major interval are sure to have come from a single resonator, but notes separated by a minor interval might be very high overtones (and hence weak and uncertain ones), or they might come from a soundmaker with a complicated shape and material that does not give out a nice clear tone, or they might not come from a single soundmaker at all. Perhaps the ambiguity of the source of a minor interval gives the auditory system a sense of unsettledness that is translated as sadness elsewhere in the brain. Wind chimes, church bells, train whistles, claxton horns, and warbling sirens can evoke an emotional response with just two harmonically related tones. Recall that a few jumps among tones are the heart of a melody; all the rest is layer upon layer of ornamentation. 3. Emotional calls. Darwin noticed that the calls of many birds and primates are composed of discrete notes in harmonic relations. He speculated that they evolved because they were easy to reproduce time after time. (Had he lived a century later, he would have said that digital representations are more repeatable than analog ones.) He suggested, not too plausibly, that human music grew out of our ancestors mating calls. But The Meaning of Life 537 his suggestion may make sense if it is broadened to include all emotional calls. Whimpering, whining, crying, weeping, moaning, growling, cooing, laughing, yelping, baying, cheering, and other ejaculations have acoustic signatures. Perhaps melodies evoke strong emotions because their skeletons resemble digitized templates of our species emotional calls. When people try to describe passages of music in words, they use these emotional calls as metaphors. Soul musicians mix their singing with growls, cries, moans, and whimpers, and singers of torch songs and country-andwestern music use catches, cracks, hesitations, and other emotional tics. Ersatz emotion is a common goal of art and recreation; I will discuss the reasons in a following section. 4. Habitat selection. We pay attention to features of the visual world that signal safe, unsafe, or changing habitats, such as distant views, greenery, gathering clouds, and sunsets (see Chapter 6). Perhaps we also pay attention to features of the auditory world that signal safe, unsafe, or changing habitats. Thunder, wind, rushing water, birdsong, growls, footsteps, heartbeats, and snapping twigs all have emotional effects, presumably because they are thrown off by attention-worthy events in the world. Perhaps some of the stripped-down figures and rhythms at the heart of a melody are simplified templates of evocative environmental sounds. In the device called tone painting, composers intentionally try to evoke environmental sounds like thunder or birdsong in a melody. Perhaps a pure example of the emotional tug of music may be found in cinematic soundtracks. Many movies and television shows literally orchestrate the viewers emotions from beginning to end with quasimusical arrangements.

In many countries a newly appointed official openly fires all the civil servants under him and replaces them with relatives. Relatives are natural allies, and before the invention of agriculture and cities, societies were organized around clans of them. One of the fundamental questions of anthropology is how foraging people divide themselves into bands or villages, typically with about fifty members though varying with the time and place. Napoleon Chagnon amassed meticulous genealogies that link thousands of members of the Yanomamo, the foraging and horticultural people of the 436 Amazon rainforest whom he has studied for thirty years. He showed how kinship is the cement that keeps villages together. Close kin fight each other less often and come to each others aid in fights more often. A village fissions when its population grows, the villagers become less related to one another, and they increasingly get on each others nerves. A fight erupts, loyalties divide along blood lines, and one party storms off with his closer kin to form a new village. A spouse is the most familiar example of fictive kin: genetically unrelated people who are called kin and claim the emotions ordinarily directed at kin. The biologist Richard Alexander has pointed out that if spouses are faithful, if each acts on behalf of the unions children rather than other blood relatives, and if the marriage lasts the lifetime of both, the genetic interests of a couple are identical. Their genes are tied up in the same package, their children, and what is good for one spouse is good for the other. Under these idealized conditions, marital love should be stronger than any other kind. In reality, peoples blood kin do claim some of their loyalties, and no one can ever be certain that a spouse is one hundred percent faithful, much less that the spouse will never desert or die. In a simpleminded species, the strength of spousal love might be set at some optimum medium level reflecting the overall probability of nepotism, infidelity, desertion, and widowhood. But humans are sensitive to the particulars of their marriages and fine-tune their emotions accordingly. It is no surprise to a biologist that in-laws, infidelity, and stepchildren are the major causes of marital strife. Because a couples genes are in the same boat, and each spouse shares genes with his or her kin, the kin have an interest in both senses of the word in their marriage. If your son marries my daughter, our genetic fortunes are partly linked in our common grandchildren, and to that extent what is good for you is good for me. Marriages make in-laws into natural allies, and that is one reason why in all cultures marriages are alliances between clans, not just between spouses. The other reason is that when parents have power over their adult children, as they had in all cultures until recently, the children are excellent trade goods. Since my children dont want to marry each other, you have something il need: Family Values 437 a spouse for my child. Thus dowries and bride-prices are ubiquitous in human cultures, though goods like status and allegiance in conflicts with third parties are also factored into the deal. Like all business transactions, the successful sale or trade of an offspring proves the good faith of the parties and makes them more likely to trust each other in the future. So in-laws are both genetic partners and business partners. For future-minded parents, in-laws should be chosen carefully. Not', 'it is widely practiced '),
(435, 62, 8, 'Knowing this principle leads me to reason as follows. Chimpanzees are omnivores, and it is not surprising that they eat onions; after all, we are omnivores, and we eat them. But gorillas are herbivores, who spend their days munching wild celery, thistles, and other plants. Herbivores are often finicky about which species they feed on, because their digestive systems are optimized to detoxify the poisons in some kinds of plants and not others (the extreme example being koalas, who specialize in eating eucalyptus leaves). So it would not surprise me if gorillas avoided the pungent onion, regardless of what chimpanzees do. Depending on which system of explanation I call to mind, chimpanzees and gorillas are either highly similar category-mates or as different as people and cows. In associationism and its implementation in connectoplasm, the way an object is represented (namely, as a set of properties) automatically commits the system to generalizing in a certain way (unless it is trained out of the generalization with specially provided contrary examples). The alternative I am pushing is that humans can mentally symbolize kinds of objects, and those symbols can be referred to in a number of rule systems we carry around in our heads. (In artificial intelligence, this technique is called explanation-based generalization, and connectionist designs are an example of the technique called similarity-based generalization.) Our rule systems couch knowledge in compositional, quantified, recursive propositions, and collections of these propositions interlock to form modules or intuitive theories about particular domains of experience, such as kinship, intuitive science, intuitive psychology, number, language, and law. Chapter 5 explores some of those domains. What good are crisp categories and systems of rules? In the social world they can adjudicate between haggling parties each pointing at the fuzzy boundary of a category, one saying something is inside and the Thinking Machines 129 other saying it is outside. Rites of passage, the age of majority, diplomas, licenses, and other pieces of legal paper draw sharp lines that all parties can mentally represent, lines that let everyone know where everyone else stands. Similarly, all-or-none rules are a defense against salami tactics, in which a person tries to take advantage of a fuzzy category by claiming one borderline case after another to his advantage. Rules and abstract categories also help in dealing with the natural world. By sidestepping similarity, they allow us to get beneath the surface and ferret out hidden laws that make things tick. And because they are, in a sense, digital, they give representations stability and precision. If you make a chain of analog copies from an analog tape, the quality declines with each generation of copying. But if you make a chain of digital copies, the last can be as good as the first. Similarly, crisp symbolic representations allow for chains of reasoning in which the symbols are copied verbatim in successive thoughts, forming what logicians call a sorites: All ravens are crows. All crows are birds. All birds are animals. All animals need oxygen. A sorites allows a thinker to draw conclusions with confidence despite meager experience. For example, a thinker can conclude that ravens need oxygen even if no one has ever actually deprived a raven of oxygen to see what happens. The thinker can reach that conclusion even if he or she has never witnessed an experiment depriving any animal of oxygen but only heard the statement from a credible expert. But if each step in the deduction were fuzzy or probabilistic or cluttered with the particulars of the category members one step before, the slop would accumulate.

A second possible prerequisite, this one found in the common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, is group living. Most apes and monkeys are gregarious, though most mammals are not. Living together has advantages. A cluster of animals is not much more detectable to a predator than a single animal, and if it is detected, the likelihood that any individual will be picked off is diluted. (Drivers feel less vulnerable speeding when they are in a group of speeders, because chances! are the traffic cop will stop someone else.) There are more eyes, ears, and noses to detect a predator, and the attacker can sometimes be mobbed. A second advantage is in foraging efficiency. The advantage is most obvious in cooperative hunting of large animals, such as in wolves and lions, but it also helps in sharing and defending other ephemeral food resources too big to be consumed by the individual who found it, such as a tree laden with ripe fruit. Primates that depend on fruit, and primates that spend time on the ground (where they are more vulnerable to predators), tend to hang out in groups. Group living could have set the stage for the evolution of humanlike intelligence in two ways. With a group already in place, the value of having better information is multiplied, because information is the one coiinmodity that can be given away and kept at the same time. Therefore a smdrter animal living in a group enjoys a double advantage: the benefit of the knowledge and the benefit of whatever it can get in trade for the knowledge. The other way in which a group can be a crucible of intelligence is that group living itself poses new cognitive challenges. There are also disRevenge of the Nerds 193 advantages to the madding crowd. Neighbors compete over food, water, mates, and nest sites. And there is the risk of exploitation. Hell is other people, said Jean-Paul Sartre, and if baboons were philosophers no doubt they would say that hell is other baboons. Social animals risk theft, cannibalism, cuckoldry, infanticide, extortion, and other treachery. Every social creature is poised between milking the benefits and suffering the costs of group living. That creates a pressure to stay on the right side of the ledger by becoming smarter. In many kinds of animals, the largest-brained and smartest-behaving species are social: bees, parrots, dolphins, elephants, wolves, sea lions, and, of course, monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees. (The orangutan, smart but almost solitary, is a puzzling exception.) Social animals send and receive signals to coordinate predation, defense, foraging, and collective sexual access. They exchange favors, repay and enforce debts, punish cheaters, and join coalitions. The collective expression for hominoids, "a shrewdness of apes," tells a story. Primates are sneaky baldfaced liars. They hide from rivals eyes to flirt, cry wolf to attract or divert attention, even manipulate their lips into a poker face. Chimpanzees monitor one anothers goals, at least crudely, and sometimes appear to use them in pedagogy and deception. One chimp, shown a set of boxes with food and one with a snake, led his companions to the snake, and after they fled screaming, feasted in peace. Vervet monkeys are yentas who keep close track of everyones comings and goings and friends and enemies.

Daly and Wilson report thirty-five samples of homicide statistics from fourteen countries, including foraging and preliterate societies and thirteenth-century England. In all of them, men kill men massively more often than women kill women on average, twenty-six times more often. Also, the poolhall avengers and their victims are nobodies: uneducated, unmarried, unprosperous, and often unemployed. Among polygynous mammals such as ourselves, reproductive success varies enormously among males, and the fiercest competition can be at the bottom, among 498 males whose prospects teeter between zero and nonzero. Men attract women by their wealth and status, so if a man doesnt have them and has no way of getting them he is on a one-way road to genetic nothingness. As with birds that venture into dangerous territories when they are near starvation, and hockey coaches that pull the goalie for an extra skater when they are a goal down with a minute to play, an unmarried man without a future should be willing to take any risk. As Bob Dylan pointed out, "When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose." Youth makes matters even worse. The population geneticist Alan Rogers has calculated from actuarial data that young men should discount the future steeply, and so they do. Young men commit crimes, drive too fast, ignore illnesses, and pick dangerous hobbies like drugs, extreme sports, and surfing on the roofs of tram cars and elevators. The combination of maleness, youth, penury, hopelessness, and anarchy makes young men indefinitely reckless in defending their reputation. And its not so clear that professors (or people in any competitive profession) dont duel over pool tables, figuratively speaking. Academics are known by their fellows as "the sort who can be pushed around" and "the sort who wont take any shit," as people whose word means action or people who are full of hot air, as guys whose work you can criticize with impunity or guys you dont want to mess with. Brandishing a switchblade at a scholarly conference would somehow strike the wrong note, but there is always the stinging question, the devastating riposte, the moralistic outrage, the withering invective, the indignant rebuttal, and means of enforcement in manuscript reviews and grant panels. Scholarly institutions, of course, try to minimize this rutting, but it is hard to eradicate. The goal of argumentation is to make a case so forceful (note the metaphor) that skeptics are coerced into believing it they are powerless to deny it while still claiming to be rational. In principle, it is the ideas themselves that are, as we say, compelling, but their champions are not always averse to helping the ideas along with tactics of verbal dominance, among them intimidation ("Clearly . . ."), threat ("It would be unscientific to . . ."), authority ("As Popper showed . . ."), insult ("This work lacks the necessary rigor for . . ."), and belittling ("Few people today seriously believe that . . ."). Perhaps this is why H. L. Mencken wrote that "college football would be more interesting if the faculty played instead of the students."

A more realistic inventory would include modes of thought and feeling for danger, contamination, status, dominance, fairness, love, friendship, sexuality, children, relatives, and the self. They are explored in later chapters. Saying that the different ways of knowing are innate is different from saying that knowledge is innate. Obviously we have to learn about Frisbees, butterflies, and lawyers. Talking about innate modules is not meant to minimize learning but to explain it. Learning involves more than recording experience; learning requires couching the records of experience so that they generalize in useful ways. A VCR is excellent at recording, but no one would look to this modern version of the blank slate as a paradigm of intelligence. When we watch lawyers in action, we draw conclusions about their goals and values, not their tongue and limb trajectories. Goals and values are one of the vocabularies in which we mentally couch our experiences. They cannot be built out of simpler concepts from our physical knowledge the way "momentum" can be built out of mass and velocity or "power" can be built out of energy and time. They are primitive or irreducible, and higher-level concepts are defined in terms of them. To understand learning in other domains, we have to find their vocabularies, too. Because a combinatorial system like a vocabulary can generate a vast number of combinations, one might wonder whether human thoughts can be generated by a single system, a general-purpose Esperanto of the mind. But even a very powerful combinatorial system has its limits. A 316 Calculator can add and multiply a vast number of vast numbers, but it will never spell a sentence. A dedicated word processor can type Borges infinite library of books with all combinations of characters, but it can never add the numbers it spells out. Modern digital computers can do a lot with a little, but that "little" still includes distinct, hard-wired vocabularies for text, graphics, logic, and several kinds of numbers. When the computers are programmed into artificial intelligence reasoning systems, they have to be innately endowed with an understanding of the basic categories of the world: objects, which cant be in two places at once, animals, which live for a single interval of time, people, who dont like pain, and so on. That is no less true of the human mind. Even a dozen innate mental vocabularies a wild and crazy idea, according to critics^would be a small number with which to spell the entirety of human thought and feeling, from the meanings of the 500,000 words in the Oxford English Dictionary to the plots of Scheherazades 1,001 tales. We live in the material world, and one of the first things in life we must figure out is how objects bump into each other and fall down elevator shafts. Until recently, everyone thought that the infants world was a kaleidoscope of sensations, a "blooming, buzzing confusion," in William James memorable words. Piaget claimed that infants were sensorimotor creatures, unaware that objects cohere and persist and that the world works by external laws rather than the infants actions. Infants would be like the man in the famous limerick about Berkeleys idealist philosophy: There once was a man who said, "God Must think it exceedingly odd If he finds that this tree Continues to be When theres no one about in the Quad."

Its not clear whether this pseudo-music distills the contours of environmental sounds, speech, emotional cries, or some combination, but it is undeniably effective. 5. Motor control. Rhythm is the universal component of music, and in many idioms it is the primary or only component. People dance, nod, shake, swing, stride, clap, and snap to music, and that is a strong hint that music taps into the system of motor control. Repetitive actions like 538 J walking, running, chopping, scraping, and digging have an optimal rhythm (usually an optimal pattern of rhythms within rhythms), which is determined by the impedances of the body and of the tools or surfaces it is working with. A good example is pushing a child on a swing. A constant rhythmic pattern is an optimal way to time these motions, and we get moderate pleasure from being able to stick to it, which athletes call getting in a groove or feeling the flow. Music and dance may be a concentrated dose of that stimulus to pleasure. Muscle control also embraces sequences of tension and release (for example, in leaping or striking), actions carried out with urgency, enthusiasm, or lassitude, and erect or slumping body postures that reflect confidence, submission, or depression. Several psychologically oriented music theorists, including Jackendoff, Manfred Clynes, and David Epstein, believe that music recreates the motivational and emotional components of movement. 6.

An unused counterpart in the right hemisphere of the speech areas in the left? Some kind of spandrel or crawl space or short-circuit or coupling that came along as an accident of the way that auditory, emotional, language, and motor circuits ard packed together in the brain? This analysis of music is speculative, but it nicely complements the discussions of the mental faculties in the rest of the book. I chose them as topics because they show the clearest signs of being adaptations. I chose music because it shows the clearest signs of not being one.

At least the narrator of Walker Percys novel The Moviegoer acknowledges the difference.

Mexican moviegoers have been known to riddle the screen with bullets. Actors complain that fans confuse them with their The Meaning of Life 539 roles; Leonard Nimoy wrote a memoir called I Am Not Spook, then gave up and wrote another one called I Am S-pock.

With all due respect to rabbinical wisdom, these arguments can be demolished by any bright twelve-year-old, and as a former temple Sunday School teacher I can attest that they regularly are. Many Jewish adults still believe that pork was banned as a public health measure, to prevent trichinosis. But as Harris points out, if that were true the law would have been a simple advisory against undercooking pork: "Flesh of swine thou shalt not eat until the pink has been cooked from it." Harris observes that food taboos often make ecological and economic sense. The Hebrews and the Muslims were desert tribes, and pigs are animals of the forest. They compete with people for water and nutritious foods like nuts, fruits, and vegetables. Kosher animals, in contrast, are Hotheads 385 ruminants like sheep, cattle, and goats, which can live off scraggly desert plants. In India, cattle are too precious to slaughter because they are used for milk, manure, and pulling plows. Harris theory is as ingenious as the rabbis and far more plausible, though he admits that it cant explain everything. Ancient tribes wandering the parched Judaean sands were hardly in danger of squandering their resources by herding shrimp and oysters, and it is unclear why the inhabitants of a Polish shtetl or a Brooklyn neighborhood should obsess over the feeding habits of desert ruminants. Food taboos are obviously an ethnic marker, but by itself that observation explains nothing. Why do people wear ethnic badges to begin with, let alone a costly one like banning a source of nutrients? The social sciences assume without question that people submerge their interests to the group, but on evolutionary grounds that is unlikely (as we shall see later in the chapter). I take a more cynical view. In any group, the younger, poorer, and disenfranchised members may be tempted to defect to other groups. The powerful, especially parents, have an interest in keeping them in. People everywhere form alliances by eating together, from potlatches and feasts to business lunches and dates. If I cant eat with you, I cant become your friend. Food taboos often prohibit a favorite food of a neighboring tribe; that is true, for example, of many of the Jewish dietary laws. That suggests that they are weapons to keep potential defectors in. First, they make the merest prelude to cooperation with outsiders breaking bread together an unmistakable act of defiance. Even better, they exploit the psychology of disgust. Taboo foods are absent during the sensitive period for learning food preferences, and that is enough to make children grow up to find them disgusting. That deters them from becoming intimate with the enemy ("He invited me over, but what will I do if they serveEEEEUUUW"!!"). Indeed, the tactic is self-perpetuating because children grow up into parents who dont feed the disgusting things to their children. The practical effects of food taboos have often been noticed. A familiar theme in novels about the immigrant experience is the protagonists torment over sampling taboo foods. Crossing the line offers a modicum of integration into the new world but provokes open conflict with parents and community. (In Portnoys Complaint, Alex describes his mother as pronouncing hamburger as if it were Hitler.) But since the elders have no desire for the community to see the taboos in this light, they cloak them in talmudic sophistry and bafflegab. 386 THE SMELL OF FEAR Language-lovers know that there is a word for every fear.

In evolutionary biology, she is the producer of the larger gamete. In mammalian physiology, she is the site of prenatal growth and birth; in genealogy, the immediate female ancestor; in some legal contexts, the guardian of the child and the spouse of the childs father. The omnibus concept "mother" depends on an idealization of the idealizations in which all the systems pick out the same entities: the contributor of the egg nurtures the embryo, bears the offspring, raises it, and marries the sperm donor. Just as friction does not refute Newton, exotic disruptions of the idealized alignment of genetics, physiology, and law do not make "mother" any fuzzier within each of these systems. Our theories, both folk and scientific, can idealize away from the messiness of the world and lay bare its underlying causal forces. Its hard to read about the human minds tendency to put things in boxes organized around a stereotype without pondering the tragedy of racism. Good Ideas 313 If people form stereotypes even about rabbits and fish, does racism come naturally to us? And if racism is both natural and irrational, does that make the love of stereotypes a bug in our cognitive software? Many social and cognitive psychologists would answer yes. They link ethnic stereotypes to an overeagerness to form categories and to an insensitivity to the laws of statistics that would show the stereotypes to be false. An Internet discussion group for neural-network modelers once debated what kinds of learning algorithms would best model Archie Bunker. The discussants assumed that people are racists when their neural networks perform poorly or are deprived of good training examples. If only our networks could use a proper learning rule and take in enough data, they would transcend false stereotypes and correctly register the facts of human equality. Some ethnic stereotypes are indeed based on bad statistics or none at all; they are a product of a coalitional psychology that automatically denigrates outsiders (see Chapter 7). Others may be based on good statistics about nonexistent people, the virtual characters we meet every day on the big and small screens: Italian goodfellas, Arab terrorists, black drug dealers, Asian kung fu masters, British spies, and so on. But sadly, some stereotypes may be based on good statistics about real people. In the United States at present, there are real and large differences among ethnic and racial groups in their average performance in school and in their rates of committing violent crimes. (The statistics, of course, say nothing about heredity or any other putative cause.) Ordinary peoples estimates of these differences are fairly accurate, and in some cases, people with more contact with a minority group, such as social workers, have more pessimistic, and unfortunately more accurate, estimates of the frequency of negative traits such as illegitimacy and welfare dependency. A good statistical category-maker could develop racial stereotypes and use them to make actuarially sound but morally repugnant decisions about individual cases. This behavior is racist not because it is irrational (in the sense of statistically inaccurate) but because it flouts the moral principle that it is wrong to judge an individual using the statistics of a racial or ethnic group. The argument against bigotry, then, does not come from the design specs for a rational statistical categorizer. It comes from a rule system, in this case a rule of ethics, that tells us when to turn our statistical categorizers off. 314 CORE CURRICULUM You have channel-surfed to a', 'number of idealized theories.

Recall that vision solves the unsolvable problem of recovering a description of the world from its projection onto the retina by making assumptions about how the world is put together, such as smooth matte shading, cohesive surfaces, and no razor-edge alignment. Optical illusions not just cereal-box material but the ones that use Leonardos window, such as paintings, photographs, movies, and television cunningly violate those assumptions and give off patterns of light that dupe our visual system into seeing scenes that arent there. Thats the lock-picking. The pleasure buttons are the content of the illusions. Everyday photographs and paintings (remember think "motel room," not "Museum of Modern Art") depict plants, animals, landscapes, and people. In previous chapters we saw how the geometry of beauty is the visible signal of adaptively valuable objects: safe, food-rich, explorable, learnable habitats, and fertile, healthy dates, mates, and babies. Less obvious is why we take pleasure in abstract art: the zigzags, plaids, tweeds, polka dots, parallels, circles, squares, stars, spirals, and splashes of color with which people decorate their possessions and bodies all over the world. It cannot be a coincidence that exactly these kinds of motifs have been posited by vision researchers as the features of the world that our perceptual analyzers lock onto as they try to make sense of the surfaces and objects out there (see Chapter 4). Straight lines, parallel lines, smooth curves, and right angles are some of the nonaccidental properties that the visual system seeks out because they are giveaways of The Meaning of Life 527 parts of the world that contain solid objects or that have been shaped by motion, tension, gravity, and cohesion. A swath of the visual field sprinkled with repetitions of a pattern usually comes from a single surface in the world, like a tree trunk, a field, a rock face, or a body of water. A hard boundary between two regions usually comes from one surface occluding another. Bilateral symmetry almost always comes from animals, parts of plants, or human artifacts. Other patterns that we find pretty help us to recognize objects by their three-dimensional shapes. Frames of reference are fitted onto bounded, elongated shapes, onto symmetrical shapes, and onto shapes with parallel or near-parallel edges. Once fitted, the shapes are mentally carved into geons (cones, cubes, and cylinders) before being matched against memory. All of the optimal geometric features for visual analysis that I have listed in the last two paragraphs are popular in visual decorations. But how do we explain the overlap? Why is the optimal feedstock for visual processing pretty to look at? First, we seem to get pleasure out of looking at purified, concentrated versions of the geometric patterns that in dilute form give us pips of microsatisfaction as we orient ourselves toward informative environments and fine-tune our vision to give us a clear picture of them. Think of the annoyance you feel when a movie is out of focus and your relief when the projectionist wakes up and twiddles the lens. The fuzzy picture resembles your own retinal image when you are not properly accommodating the lens of your eye. The dissatisfaction is the impetus to accommodate; the satisfaction tells you when you have succeeded.

Birds could not have evolved propellers, even if that had been advantageous. But many claims of biological constraints are howlers. One cognitive scientist has opined that "many properties of organisms, like symmetry, for example, do not really have anything to do with specific selection but just with the ways in which things can exist in the physical world." In fact, most things that exist in the physical world are not symmetrical, for obvious reasons of probability: among all the possible arrangements of a volume of matter, only a tiny fraction are symmetrical. Even in the living world, the molecules of life are asymmetrical, as are livers, hearts, stomachs, flounders, snails, lobsters, oak trees, and so on. Symmetry has everything to do with selection. Organisms that move in straight lines have bilaterally symmetrical external forms because otherwise they would go in circles. Symmetry is so improbable and difficult to achieve that any disease or defect can disrupt it, and many animals size up the health of prospective mates by checking for minute asymmetries. Gould has emphasized that natural selection has only limited freedom to alter basic body plans. Much of the plumbing, wiring, and architecture of the vertebrates, for example, has been unchanged for hundreds of millions of years. Presumably they come from embryological recipes that cannot easily be tinkered with. But the vertebrate body plan accommodates eels, cows, hummingbirds, aardvarks, ostriches, toads, gerbils, seahorses, giraffes, and blue whales. The similarities are imporRevenge of the Nerds 169 tant, but the differences are important, too! Developmental constraints only rule out broad classes of options. They cannot, by themselves, force a functioning organ to come into being. An embryological constraint like "Thou shalt grow wings" is an absurdity. The vast majority of hunks of animal flesh do not meet the stringent engineering demands of powered flight, so it is infinitesimally unlikely that the creeping and bumping cells in the microscopic layers of the developing embryo are obliged to align themselves into bones, skin, muscles, and feathers with just the right architecture to get the bird aloft unless, of course, the developmental program had been shaped to bring about that outcome by the history of successes and failures of the whole body. Natural selection should not be pitted against developmental, genetic, or phylogenetic constraints, as if the more important one of them is, the less important the others are. Selection versus constraints is a phony dichotomy, as crippling to clear thinking as the dichotomy between innateness and learning. Selection can only select from alternatives that are growable as carbon-based living stuff, but in the absence of selection that stuff could just as easily grow into scar tissue, scum, tumors, warts, tissue cultures, and quivering amorphous protoplasm as into functioning organs. Thus selection and constraints are both important but are answers to different questions. The question "Why does this creature have suchand- such an organ:*" by itself is meaningless. It can only be asked when followed by a compared-to-what phrase. Why do birds have wings (as opposed to propellers)? Because you cant grow a vertebrate with propellers. Why do birds have wings (as opposed to forelegs or hands or stumps)? Because selection favored ancestors of birds that could fly. Another widespread misconception is that if an organ changed its function in the course of evolution, it did not evolve by natural selection. One discovery has been cited over and over in support of the misconception: the wings of insects', 'of its action at '),

Dowries, which are more familiar to us, are not a mirror image of bride-wealth, because they go to the newlyweds, not to the brides parents. The husband notifies other men of his ownership in customs retained by many modern couples. The woman, not the man, wears an engagement ring, bears her spouses surname, and is given a new form of address, Mrs., short for "mistress of." People can control their property, and husbands (and before them, Family Values 491 fathers and brothers) have controlled womens sexuality. They have used chaperones, veils, wigs, chadors, segregation by sex, confinement, foot-binding, genital mutilation, and the many ingenious designs for chastity belts. Despots not only kept harems but kept them guarded. In traditional societies, "protecting a woman" was a euphemism for keeping her chaste. (Mae West observed, "Men always say theyre protecting you, but they never say from what.") Only fertile women were controlled in these ways; children and postmenopausal women had more freedom. The word adultery is related to the word adulterate and refers to making a woman impure by introducing an improper substance. The infamous double standard, in which a married womans philandering is punished more severely than a married mans, is common in legal and moral codes in all kinds of societies. Its rationale was succinctly captured when James Boswell remarked, "There is a great difference between the offence of infidelity in a man and that of his wife," and Samuel Johnson replied, "The difference is boundless. The man imposes no bastards on his wife." Both the married woman and her lover are commonly punishable (often by death), but the symmetry is illusory, because it is the womans marital status, not the mans, that makes it a crime, specifically, a crime against her husband. Until recently most of the worlds legal systems treated adultery as a property violation or tort. The husband was entitled to damages, a refund of the bride-price, a divorce, or the right to violent revenge. Rape was an offense against the womans husband, not against the woman. Elopement was considered an abduction of a daughter from her father. Until very recently, the rape of a woman by her husband was not a crime, or even a coherent concept: husbands were entitled to sex with their wives. Throughout the English-speaking world, the common law recognizes three circumstances that reduce murder to manslaughter: self-defense, the defense of close relatives, and sexual contact with the mans wife. (Wilson and Daly observe that they are the three main threats to Darwinian fitness.) In several American states, including Texas as recently as 1974, a man who discovered his wife in flagrante delicto and killed her lover was not guilty of a crime. Even today, in many places those homicides are not prosecuted or the killer is treated leniently. Jealous rage at the sight of a wifes adultery is cited as one of the ways a "reasonable man" can be expected to behave. 492 1 wish I could have discussed the evolutionary psychology of sexuality without the asides about feminist theory, but in todays intellectual climate that is impossible.

Mechanically speaking, the more clue units there are that are turned on, the greater the activation of the conclusion unit. We could implement different statistical procedures in the network by designing the conclusion unit to integrate its inputs in different ways. For example, the conclusion unit could be a threshold unit like the ones in crisp logic gates; that would implement a policy to put out a decision only if the weight of evidence exceeded a critical value (say, "beyond a reasonable doubt"). Or the conclusion unit could increase its activity gradually; its degree of confidence could increase slowly with the first clues trickling in, build quickly as more and more are amassed, and level off at a point of diminishing returns. These are two of the kinds of unit that neuralnetwork modelers like to use. We can get even more adventurous, and take inspiration from the fact that with neurons, unlike silicon chips, connections are cheap. Why not connect every unit to every other unit? Such a network would embody not only the knowledge that greenness predicts vegetablehood and crunchiness predicts vegetablehood, but that greenness predicts crunchiness, crunchiness predicts leafiness, greenness predicts lack of mobility, and so on: 104 J With this move, interesting things begin to happen. The network begins to resemble human thought processes in ways that sparsely connected networks do not. For this reason psychologists and artificial intelligence researchers have been using everything-connected-to-everything networks to model many examples of simple pattern recognition. They have built networks for the lines that co-occur in letters, the letters that co-occur in words, the animal parts that co-occur in animals, and the pieces of furniture that co-occur in rooms. Often the decision node at the top is thrown away and only the correlations among the properties are calculated. These networks, sometimes called auto-associators, have five nifty features. First, an auto-associator is a reconstructive, content-addressable memory. In a commercial computer, the bits themselves are meaningless, and the bytes made out of them have arbitrary addresses, like houses on a street, which have nothing to do with their contents. Memory locations are accessed by their addresses, and to determine whether a pattern has been stored somewhere in memory you have to search them all (or use clever shortcuts). In a content-addressable memory, on the other hand, specifying an item automatically lights up any location in memory containing a copy of the item. Since an item is represented in an auto-associator by turning on the units that represent its properties (in this case celery, greenness, leafiness, and so on), and since those units are connected to one another with strong weights, the activated units will reinforce one another, and after a few rounds in which activation reverberates through the network, all the units pertaining to the item will lock into the "on" position. That indicates that the item has been recognized. In fact, a single auto-associator can accommodate many sets of weights in its battery of connections, not just one, so it can store many items at a time. Better yet, the', 'Once a network is '),

In culture after culture, people believe that the soul lives on after death, that rituals can change the physical world and divine the truth, and that illness and misfortune are caused and alleviated by spirits, ghosts, saints, fairies, angels, demons, cherubim, djinns, devils, and gods. According to polls, more than a quarter of todays Americans believe in witches, almost half believe in ghosts, half believe in the devil, half believe that the book of Genesis is literally true, sixty-nine percent believe in angels, eighty-seven percent believe that Jesus was raised from the dead, and ninety-six percent believe in a God or universal spirit. How does religion fit into a mind that one might have thought was designed to reject the palpably not true? The common answer that people take The Meaning of Life 555 comfort in the thought of a benevolent shepherd, a universal plan, or an afterlife is unsatisfying, because it only raises the question of why a mind would evolve to find comfort in beliefs it can plainly see are false. A freezing person finds no comfort in believing he is warm; a person faceto- face with a lion is not put at ease by the conviction that it is a rabbit. What is religion? Like the psychology of the arts, the psychology of religion has been muddied by scholars attempts to exalt it while understanding it. Religion cannot be equated with our higher, spiritual, humane, ethical yearnings (though it sometimes overlaps with them). The Bible contains instructions for genocide, rape, and the destruction of families, and even the Ten Commandments, read in context, prohibit murder, lying, and theft only within the tribe, not against outsiders. Religions have given us stonings, witch-burnings, crusades, inquisitions, jihads, fatwas, suicide bombers, abortion-clinic gunmen, and mothers who drown their sons so they can be happily reunited in heaven. As Blaise Pascal wrote, "Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction." Religion is not a single topic. What we call religion in the modern West is an alternative culture of laws and customs that survived alongside those of the nation-state because of accidents of European history. Religions, like other cultures, have produced great art, philosophy, and law, but their customs, like those of other cultures, often serve the interests of the people who promulgate them. Ancestor worship must be an appealing idea to people who are about to become ancestors. As ones days dwindle, life begins to shift from an iterative prisoners dilemma, in which defection can be punished and cooperation rewarded, to a oneshot prisoners dilemma, in which enforcement is impossible. If you can convince your children that your soul will live on and watch over their affairs, they are less emboldened to defect while you are alive. Food taboos keep members of the tribe from becoming intimate with outsiders. Rites of passage demarcate the people who are entitled to the privileges of social categories (fetus or family member, child or adult, single or married) so as to preempt endless haggling over gray areas. Painful initiations weed out anyone who wants the benefits of membership without being committed to paying the costs. Witches are often mothers-inlaw and other inconvenient people. Shamans and priests are Wizards of Oz who use special effects, from sleight-of-hand and ventriloquism to sumptuous temples and cathedrals, to convince others that they are privy to forces of power and wonder. 556 J Lets focus on the truly distinctive part of the psychology of religion.

Recently the Serbs in Bosnia and the Hutus in Rwanda have added themselves to this list. Prostitution, which in wartime is often hard to Family Values 513 distinguish from rape, is a ubiquitous perquisite of soldiers. Leaders may sometimes use rape as a terror tactic to attain other ends, as Henry V obviously did, but the tactic is effective precisely because the soldiers are so eager to implement it, as Henry took pains to remind the Frenchmen. In fact it often backfires by giving the defenders an incalculable incentive to fight on, and probably for that reason, more than out of compassion for enemy women, modern armies have outlawed rape. Even when rape is not a prominent part of our warfare, we invest our war leaders with enormous prestige, just as the Yanomamo do, and by now you know the effects of prestige on a mans sexual attractiveness and, until recently, his reproductive success. War, or aggression by a coalition of individuals, is rare in the animal kingdom. You would think that the second-, third-, and fourth-strongest elephant seals would gang up, kill the strongest male, and divide his harem among them, but they never do. Aside from the social insects, whose unusual genetic system makes them a special case, only humans, chimpanzees, dolphins, and perhaps bonobos join up in groups of four or more to attack other males. These are some of the largest-brained species, hinting that war may require sophisticated mental machinery. Tooby and Cosmides have worked out the adaptive logic of coalitional aggression and the cognitive mechanisms necessary to support it. (That does not, of course, mean that they think war is unavoidable or "natural" in the sense of "good.") People often are conscripted into armies, but sometimes they enlist with gusto. Jingoism is alarmingly easy to evoke, even without a scarce resource to fight over. In numerous experiments by Henri Tajfel and other social psychologists, people are divided into two groups, actually at random but ostensibly by some trivial criterion such as whether they underestimate or overestimate the number of dots on a screen or whether they prefer the paintings of Klee or Kandinsky. The people in each group instantly dislike and think worse of the people in the other group, and act to withhold rewards from them even if doing so is costly to their own group. This instant ethnocentrism can be evoked even if the experimenter drops the charade with the dots or paintings and divides people into groups by flipping a coin before their eyes! The behavioral 514 J consequences are by no means minor. In a classic experiment, the social psychologist Muzafer Sherif carefully selected a group of well-adjusted, middle-class American boys for a summer camp, and randomly divided them into two groups which then competed in sports and skits. Within days the groups were brutalizing and raiding each other with sticks, bats, and rocks in socks, forcing the experimenters to intervene for the boys safety. The enigma of war is why people volunteer for an activity that has an excellent chance of getting them killed. How could a desire to play Russian roulette have evolved?

These men, who included Henry Kissinger (on whom Sellers based his portrayal), Herman Kahn, John von Neumann, and Edward Teller, were stereotyped as amoral nerds who cheerfully filled blackboards with equations about megadeaths and mutual assured destruction. Perhaps the scariest thing about them was their paradoxical conclusions for example, that safety in the nuclear age comes from exposing ones cities and protecting ones missiles. But the unsettling paradoxes of nuclear strategy apply to any conflict between parties whose interests-are partly competing and partly shared. Common sense says that victory goes to the side with the most intelligence, self-interest, coolness, options, power, and clear lines of communication. Common sense is wrong. Each of these assets can be a liability in contests of strategy (as opposed to contests of chance, skill, or strength), where behavior is calculated by predicting what the other guy will do in response. Thomas Schelling has shown that the paradoxes are ubiquitous in social life. We shajl see that they offer great insight into the emotions, particularly the headstrong passions that convinced the Romantics that emotion and reason were opposites. But first lets put the emotions aside and just examine the logic of conflicts of strategy. Take bargaining. When two people haggle over a car or a house, a bargain is struck when one side makes the final concession. Why does he concede? Because he is sure she will not. The reason she wont concede is that she thinks he will concede. She thinks he will because she thinks he thinks she thinks he will. And so on. There always is a range of prices that the buyer and seller would both accept. Even if a particular price within that range is not the best price for one party, it is preferable to canceling the deal outright.

(449, 76, 8, 'propelled us to civilization In this chapter I present a distinctly unromantic theory of the emotions. It combines the computational theory of mind, which says that the lifeblood of the psyche is information rather than energy, with the modern theory of evolution, which calls for reverse-engineering the complex design of biological systems. I will show that the emotions are adaptations, well-engineered software modules that work in harmony with the intellect and are indispensable to the functioning of the whole mind. The problem with the emotions is not that they are untamed forces or vestiges of our animal past; it is that they were designed to propagate copies of the genes that built them rather than to promote happiness, wisdom, or moral values. We often call an act "emotional" when it is harmful to the social group, damaging to the actors happiness in the long run, uncontrollable and impervious to persuasion, or a product of selfdelusion. Sad to say, these outcomes are not malfunctions but precisely what we would expect from well-engineered emotions. The emotions are another part of the mind that has been prematurely written off as nonadaptive baggage. The neuroscientist Paul Mac Lean took the Romantic doctrine of the emotions and translated it into a famous but incorrect theory known as the Triune Brain. He described the human cerebrum as an evolutionary palimpsest of three layers. At the bottom are the basal ganglia or Reptilian Brain, the seat of the primitive and selfish emotions driving the "Four Fs": feeding, fighting, fleeing, and sexual behavior. Grafted onto it is the limbic system or Primitive Mammalian Brain, which is dedicated to the kinder, gentler, social emotions, like those behind parenting. Wrapped around that is Hotheads 371 the Modern Mammalian Brain, the neocortex that grew wild in human evolution and that houses the intellect. The belief that the emotions are animal legacies is also familiar from pop ethology documentaries in which snarling baboons segue into rioting soccer hooligans as the voiceover frets about whether we will rise above our instincts and stave off nuclear doom. One problem for the triune theory is that the forces of evolution do not just heap layers on an unchanged foundation. Natural selection has to work with what is already around, but it can modify what it finds. Most parts of the human body came from ancient mammals and before them ancient reptiles, but the parts were heavily modified to fit features of the human lifestyle, such as upright posture. Though our bodies carry vestiges of the past, they have few parts that were unmodifiable and adapted only to the needs of older species. Even the appendix is currently put to use, by the immune system. The circuitry for the emotions was not left untouched, either. Admittedly, some traits are so much a part of the architectural plan of an organism that selection is powerless to tinker with them. Might the software for the emotions be burned so deeply into the brain that organisms are condemned to feel as their remote ancestors did? The evidence says no; the emotions are easy to reprogram. Emotional repertoires vary wildly among animals depending on their species, sex, and age. Within the mammals, we find the lion and the lamb. Even within dogs (a single species), a few millennia of selective breeding have given us pit bulls and Saint Bernards. The genus closest to ours embraces common chimpanzees, in which gangs of males massacre rival gangs and females can murder one anothers babies, and the pygmy chimpanzees (bonobos), whose philosophy is "Make love not war."

The population then exploded in Africa and spun off small bands that moved to other corners of the world, possibly mating now and again with other early humans in their path. Many geneticists believe that evolution is especially rapid when scattered populations exchange occasional migrants. Natural selection can quickly adapt each group to local conditions, so one or more can cope with any new challenge that arises, and their handy genes will then be imported by the neighbors. Perhaps this period saw a final flowering in the evolution of the human mind.0 All reconstructions of our evolutionary history are controversial, and the conventional wisdom changes monthly. But I predict that the closing date of our biological evolution will creep later, and the opening date of the archeological revolution will creep earlier, until they coincide. Our minds and our way of life evolved together. WHAT NOW? Are we still evolving? Biologically, probably not much. Evolution has no momentum, so we will not turn into the creepy bloat-heads of science fiction. The modern human condition is not conducive to real evolution either. We infest the whole habitable and not-so-habitable earth, migrate at will, and zigzag from lifestyle to lifestyle. This makes us a nebulous, moving target for natural selection. If the species is evolving at all, it is happening too slowly and unpredictably for us to know the direction. But Victorian hopes spring eternal. If genuine natural selection cannot improve us, maybe a human-made substitute can. The social sciences are filled with claims that new kinds of adaptation and selection have extended the biological kind. But the claims, I think, are misleading. 206 The first claim is that the world contains a wonderful process called "adaptation" that causes organisms to solve problems. Now, in Darwins strict sense, adaptation in the present is caused by selection in the past. Remember how natural selection gives an illusion of teleology: selection may look like it is adapting each organism to its needs in the present, but really it is just favoring the descendants of organisms that were adapted to their own needs in the past. The genes that built the most adaptive bodies and minds among our ancestors got passed down to build the innate bodies and minds of today (including innate abilities to track certain kinds of environmental variation, as in tanning, callusing, and learning)- But for some, that does not go far enough; adaptation happens daily. "Darwinian social scientists" such as Paul Turke and Laura Betzig believe that "modern Darwinian theory predicts that human behaviorwill be adaptive, that is, designed to promote maximum reproductive successthrough available descendent and nondescendent relatives." "Functionalists" such as the psychologists Elizabeth Bates and Brian MacWhinney say that they "view the selectional processes operating during evolution and the selectional processes operating during [learning] as part of one seamless natural fabric." The implication is that theire is no need for specialized mental machinery: if adaptation simply makes organisms do the right thing, who could ask for anything more? The optimal solution to a problem eating with ones hands, finding the right mate, inventing tools, using grammatical language is simply inevitable. The problem with functionalism is that it is Lamarckian. Not in the sense of Lamarcks second principle, the inheritance of acquired characteristics the giraffes who stretched their necks and begat baby giraffes with necks pre-stretched.

Rules and symbols might be useful as a rough-and-ready approximation to what is happening in a network for a psychologist who cant keep track of the millions of streams of activation flowing through the connections, but they are no more than that. The other view which I favor is that those neural networks alone cannot do the job. It is the structuring of networks into programs for manipulating symbols that explains much of human intelligence. In particular, symbol manipulation underlies human language and the parts of reasoning that interact with it. Thats not all of cognition, but its a lot of it; its everything we can talk about to ourselves and others. In my day job as a psycholinguist I have gathered evidence that even the simplest of talents that go into speaking English, such as forming the past tense of verbs (walk into walked, come into came), is too computationally sophisticated to be handled Thinking Machines 113 in a single neural network. In this section, I will present a more general class of evidence. Does the content of our common-sense thoughts (the kind of information we exchange in conversation) require a computational device designed to implement a highly structured rhentalese, or can it be handled by generic neural-network stuff what one wag has called connectoplasm? I will show you that our thoughts have a delicate logical structuring that no simple network of homogeneous layers of units can handle. Why should you care? Because these demonstrations cast doubt on the most influential theory of that has ever been proposed. By itself, a perceptron or a hidden-layer network is a high-tech implementation of an ancient doctrine: the association of ideas. The British philosophers John Locke, David Hume, George Berkeley, David Hartley, and John Stuart Mill proposed that thought is governed by two laws. One is contiguity: ideas that are frequently experienced together get associated in the mind. Thereafter, when one is activated, the other is activated too. The other law is resemblance: when two ideas are similar, whatever has been associated with the first idea is automatically associated with the second. As Hume summed up the theory in 1748: Experience shows us a number of uniform effects, resulting from certain objects. When a new object, endowed with similar sensible qualities, is produced, we expect similar powers and forces, and look for a like effect. From a body of like color and consistence with bread we expect like nourishment and support. Association by contiguity and resemblance was also thought to be the scrivener that fills the famous blank slate, Lockes metaphor for the neonate mind. The doctrine, called associarionism. dominated British and American views of the mind for centuries, and to a large extent still does. When the "ideas" were replaced by stimuli and responses, associationism became behaviorism. The blank slate and the two general-purpose laws of learning are also the psychological underpinnings of the Standard Social Science Model. We hear it in cliches about how our upbringing leads us to "associate food with love, wealth with happiness, height with power, and so on. Until recently, associationism was too vague to test. But neural-network models, which are routinely simulated on computers, make the ideas precise. The learning scheme, in which a teacher presents the network with an input and the correct output and the network strives to duplicate the pairing in the future, is a good model of the law of contigu114 ity.

But even within a modern state society where it serves no purpose, the emotion of vengeance cannot easily be turned off. Most legal theories, even from the highest-minded philosophers, acknowledge that retribution is one of the legitimate goals of criminal punishment, 414 over and above the goals of deterring potential criminals and incapacitating, deterring, and rehabilitating the offender. Enraged crime victims, long disenfranchised from the American legal system, have recently pressed for a say in plea-bargaining and sentencing decisions. As Strangelove explained, the whole point of a doomsday machine is lost if you keep it a secret. That principle may explain one of the longeststanding puzzles of the emotions: why we advertise them on our face. Darwin himself never argued that facial expressions were naturally selected adaptations. In fact, his theory was downright Lamarckian. Animals have to move their faces for practical reasons: they bare the teeth to bite, widen the eyes for a panoramic view, and pull back the ears to protect them in a fight. These measures turned into habits that the animal performed when it merely anticipated an event. The habits were then passed to their offspring. It may seem strange that Darwin was no Darwinian in one of his most famous books, but remember that Darwin was fighting on two fronts. He had to explain adaptations to satisfy his fellow biologists, but he also made much of pointless features and animal vestiges in humans to combat creationists, who argued that functional design was a sign of Gods handiwork. If God had really designed humans from scratch, Darwin asked, why would he have installed features that are useless to us but similar to features that are useful to animals? Many psychologists still cant understand why broadcasting ones emotional state might be beneficial. Wouldnt the proverbial smell of fear just egg on ones enemies? One psychologist has tried to revive an old idea that facial muscles are tourniquets that send more blood to the parts of the brain that have to cope with the current challenge. Aside from being hydraulically improbable, the theory cannot explain why we are more expressive when there are other people around. But if the passionate emotions are guarantors of threats and promises, advertising is their reason for being. But here a problem arises. Remember that real emotions create a niche for sham emotions. Why whip yourself into a rage when you can simulate a rage, deter your enemies, and not pay the price of pursuing dangerous vengeance if it fails? Let others be doomsday machines, and you can reap the benefits of the terror they sow. Of course, when counterfeit facial expressions begin to drive out Hotheads 415 the real ones, people call each others bluffs, and the facial expressions, real and fake, become worthless. Facial expressions are useful only if they are hard to fake. As a matter of fact, they are hard to fake. People dont really believe that the grinning flight attendant is happy to see them. That is because a social smile is formed with a different configuration of muscles from the genuine smile of pleasure.

(A simple demonstration is the railroad track paradox most people see the tracks converge in their mental image, not just in real life.) To remember an object, we turn it over or walk around it, and that means our memory for it is an album of separate views. An image of the whole object is a slide show or pastiche. That explains why perspective in art took so long to be invented, even though everyone sees in perspective. Paintings without Renaissance craftsmanship look unrealistic, but not because they lack perspective outright. (Even Cro-Magnon cave paintings have a measure of accurate perspective.) Usually, distant objects are smaller, opaque objects hide their backgrounds and take bites out of objects behind them, and many tilted surfaces are foreshortened. The problem is that different parts of the painting are shown as they would appear from different vantage points, rather than from the fixed viewing reticle behind Leonardos window. No incarnate perceiver, chained to one place at one time, can experience a scene from several vantage points at once, so the painting does not correspond to anything a person ever sees. The imagination, of course, is not chained to one place at one time, and paintings without true perspective may, strangely enough, be evocative renditions of our mental imagery. Cubist and surrealist painters, who were avid consumers of psychology, used multiple perspectives in a painting deliberately, perhaps to awaken photograph-jaded viewers to the evanescence of the minds eye. A second limitation is that images are slaves to the organization of memory. Our knowledge of the world could not possibly fit into one big picture or map. There are too many scales, from mountains to fleas, to fit into one medium with a fixed grain size. And our visual memory could not very well be a shoebox stuffed with photographs, either. There would be no way to find the one you need without examining each one to recognize whats in it. (Photo and video archives face a similar problem.) The Minds Eye 295 Memory images must be labeled and organized within a propositional superstructure, perhaps a bit like hypermedia, where graphics files are linked to attachment points within a large text or database. Visual thinking is often driven more strongly by the conceptual knowledge we use to organize our images than by the contents of the images themselves. Chess masters are known for their remarkable memory for the pieces on a chessboard. But its not because people with photographic memories become chess masters. The masters are no better than beginners when remembering a board of randomly arranged pieces. Their memory captures meaningful relations among the pieces, such as threats and defenses, not just their distribution in space. Another example comes from a wonderfully low-tech experiment by the psychologists Raymond Nickerson and Marilyn Adams. They asked people to draw both sides of a penny, which everyone has seen thousands of times, from memory. (Try it before you read on.) The results are sobering. An American penny has eight features: Abraham Lincolns profile, IN GOD WE TRUST, a year, and LIBERTY on one side, and the Lincoln Memorial, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, E PLURIBUS UNUM, and ONE CENT on t h e Other. Only five percent of the subjects drew all eight. The median number remembered was three, and half were in the wrong place.

The mind, he said, is overdesigned for the needs of evolving humans and cannot be explained by natural selection. Instead, "a superior intelligence has guided the 299 300 J development of man in a definite direction, and for a special purpose." Ettu! Wallace became a creationist when he noted that foragers "savages," in nineteenth-century parlance were biologically equal to modern Europeans. Their brains were the same size, and they could easily adapt to the intellectual demands of modern life. But in the foragers way of life, which was also the life of our evolutionary ancestors, that level of intelligence was not needed, and there was no occasion to show it off. How, then, could it have evolved in response to the needs of a foraging lifestyle? Wallace wrote: Our law, our government, and our science continually require us to reason through a variety of complicated phenomena to the expected result. Even our games, such as chess, compel us to exercise all these faculties in a remarkable degree. Compare this with the savage languages, which contain no words for abstract conceptions; the utter want of foresight of the savage man beyond his simplest necessities; his inability to combine, or to compare, or to reason on any general subject that does not immediately appeal to his senses.. . . A brain one-half larger than that of the gorilla wouldfully have sufficed for the limited mental development of the savage; and we must therefore admit that the large brain he actually possesses could never have been solely developed by any of those laws of evolution, whose essence is, that they lead to a degree of organization exactly proportionate to the wants of each species, never beyond those wants.Natural selection could only have endowed savage man with a brain a few degrees superior to that of an ape, whereas he actually possesses one very little inferior to that of a philosopher. Wallaces paradox, the apparent evolutionary uselessness of human intelligence, is a central problem of psychology, biology, and the scientific worldview. Even today, scientists such as the astronomer Paul Davies think that the "overkill" of human intelligence refutes Darwinism and calls for some other agent of a "progressive evolutionary trend," perhaps a self-organizing process that will be explained someday by complexity theory. Unfortunately this is barely more satisfying than Wallaces idea of a superior intelligence guiding the development of man in a definite direction. Much of this book, and this chapter in particular, is aimed at demoting Wallaces paradox from a foundation-shaking mystery to a challenging but otherwise ordinary research problem in the human sciences. Good Ideas 301 Stephen Jay Gould, in an illuminating essay on Darwin and Wallace, sees Wallace as an extreme adaptationist who ignores the possibility of exaptations: adaptive structures that are "fortuitously suited to other roles if elaborated" (such as jaw bones becoming middle-ear bones) and "features that arise without functionsbut remain available for later co-optation" (such as the pandas thumb, which is really a jury-rigged wristbone).

Our obliviousness to left-and-right stands in stark contrast to our hypersensitivity to up-and-down and front-and-back. Apparently the human mind does not have a preexisting label for the third dimension of its object-centered reference frame. When it sees a hand, it can align the wrist-fingertip axis with "down-up," and the back-palm axis with "backward- forward," but the direction of the pinkie-thumb axis is up for grabs. The mind calls it, say, "thumbward," and the left and right hands become mental synonyms. Our indecisiveness about left and right needs an 278 explanation, because a geometer would say they are no different from up and down or front and back. The explanation is that mirror-image confusions come naturally to a bilaterally symmetrical animal. A perfectly symmetrical creature is logically incapable of telling left from right (unless it could react to the decay of cobalt 60!). Natural selection had little incentive to build animals asymmetrically so that they could mentally represent shapes differently from their reflections. Actually, this puts it backwards: natural selection had every incentive to build animals symmetrically so that they would not represent shapes differently from their reflections. In the intermediate-sized world in which animals spend their days (bigger than subatomic particles and organic molecules, smaller than a weather front), left and right make no difference. Objects from dandelions to mountains have tops that differ conspicuously from their bottoms, and most things that move have fronts that differ conspicuously from their behinds. But no natural object has a left side that differs nonrandomly from its right, making its mirror-image version behave differently. If a predator comes from the right, next time it might come from the left. Anything learned from the first encounter should generalize to the mirror- image version. Another way of putting it is that if you took a photographic slide of any natural scene, it would be obvious if someone had turned it upside down, but you wouldnt notice if someone had flipped it left-to-right, unless the scene contained a human-made object like a car or writing. And that brings us back to letters and mental rotation. In a few human activities, like driving and writing, left and right do make a difference, and we learn to tell them apart. How? The human brain and body are slightly asymmetrical. One hand is dominant, owing to the asymmetry of the brain, and we can feel the difference. (Older dictionaries used to define "right" as the side of the body with the stronger hand, based on the assumption that people are righties. More recent dictionaries, perhaps out of respect for an oppressed minority, use a different asymmetrical object, the earth, and define "right" as east when you are facing north.) The usual way that people tell an object from its mirror image is by turning it so it faces up and forward and looking at which side of their body the side with the dominant hand', 'right shoes look so '),

They frequently raid neighboring territories and kill any stranger who blunders into theirs. We could afford this wanderlust because of our intellect. People explore a new landscape and draw up a mental resource map, rich in details about water, plants, animals, routes, and shelter. And if they can, they make their new homeland into a savanna. Native Americans and Australian aborigines used to burn huge swaths of woodland, opening them up for colonization by grasses. The ersatz savanna attracted grazing animals, which were easy to hunt, and exposed visitors before they got too close. The biologist George Orians, an expert on the behavioral ecology of birds, recently turned his eye to the behavioral ecology of humans. With Judith Heerwagen, Stephen Kaplan, Rachel Kaplan, and others, he argues that our sense of natural beauty is the mechanism that drove our ancestors into suitable habitats. We innately find savannas beautiful, but we also like a landscape that is easy to explore and remember, and that we have lived in long enough to know its ins and outs. In experiments on human habitat preference, American children and adults are shown slides of landscapes and asked how much they would like to visit or live in them. The children prefer savannas, even though they have never been to one. The adults like the savannas, too, but they like the deciduous and coniferous forests -which resemble much of the habitable United States just as much. No one likes the deserts and the rainforests. One interpretation is that the children are revealing our species default habitat preference, and the adults supplement it with the land with which they have grown familiar. Of course, people do not have a mystical longing for ancient homelands. They are merely pleased by the landscape features that savannas tend to have. Orians and Heerwagen surveyed the professional wisdom of gardeners, photographers, and painters to learn what kinds of landscapes people find beautiful. They treated it as a second kind of data on human tastes in habitats, supplementing the experiments on peoples reactions to slides. The landscapes thought to be the loveliest, they found, are dead ringers for an optimal savanna: semi-open space (neither completely exposed, which leaves one vulnerable, nor overgrown, which impedes vision and movement), even ground cover, views to the horizon, large trees, water, changes in elevation, and multiple paths leading out. The geographer Jay Appleton succinctly captured what makes a landscape appealing: prospect and refuge, or seeing without being seen. The combination allows us to learn the lay of the land safely. Hotheads 377 The land itself must be legible, too. Anyone who has lost a trail in a dense forest or seen footage of sand dunes or snow drifts in all directions knows the terror of an environment lacking a frame of reference. A landscape is just a very big object, and we recognize complex objects by locating their parts in a reference frame belonging to the object (see Chapter 4). The reference frames in a mental map are big landmarks, like trees, rocks, and ponds, and long paths or boundaries, like rivers and mountain ranges. A vista without these guideposts is unsettling. Kaplan and Kaplan found another key to natural beauty, which they call mystery. Paths bending around hills, meandering streams, gaps in foliage, undulating land, and partly blocked views grab our interest by hinting that the land may have important features that could be discovered by further', 'savanna and then other '),
(457, 84, 8, 'see all my wealth and earning power my bank account my lands, all my allies and flunkeys), but you can see my gold bathroom fixtures. No one could afford them without wealth to spare, therefore you know I am wealthy. Conspicuous consumption is counterintuitive because squandering wealth can only reduce it, bringing the squanderer down to the level of his or her rivals. But it works when other peoples esteem is useful enough to pay for and when not all the wealth or earning power is sacrificed. If I have a hundred dollars and you have forty, I can give away fifty, but you cant; I will impress others and still be richer than you. The principle has been confirmed from an unlikely source, evolutionary biology. Biologists since Darwin had been puzzled by displays like the peacocks tail, which impresses the peahen but consumes nutrients, hinders movement, and attracts predators. The biologist Amotz Zahavi proposed that the displays evolved because they were handicaps. Only the healthiest animals could afford them, and females choose the healthiest birds to Family Values 501 mate with. Theoretical biologists were initially skeptical, but one of them, Alan Grafen, later proved that the theory was sound. Conspicuous consumption works when only the richest can afford luxuries. When the class structure loosens, or sumptuous goods (or good imitations) become widely available, the upper middle class can emulate the upper class, the middle class can emulate the upper middle class, and so on down the ladder. The upper class cannot very well stand by as they begin to resemble the hoi polloi; they must adopt a new look. But then the look is emulated once again by the upper middle class and begins to trickle down again, prompting the upper class to leap to yet a different look, and so on. The result is fashion. The chaotic cycles of style, in which the chic look of one decade becomes dowdy or slutty, nerdy or foppish in the next, has been explained as a conspiracy of clothing makers, an expression of nationalism, a reflection of the economy, and much else. But Quentin Bell, in his classic analysis of fashion, On Human Finery, showed that only one explanation works: people follow the rule, "Try to look like the people above you; if youre at the top, try to look different from the people below you." Once again animals discovered the trick first. The other dandies of the animal kingdom, butterflies, did not evolve their colors to impress the females. Some species evolved to be poisonous or distasteful, and warned their predators with gaudy colors. Other poisonous kinds copied the colors, taking advantage of the fear already sown. But then some nowpoisonous butterflies copied the colors, too, enjoying the protection while avoiding the expense of making themselves distasteful. When the mimics become too plentiful, the colors no longer conveyed information and no longer deterred the predators. The distasteful butterflies evolved new colors, which were then mimicked by the palatable ones, and so on. Wealth is not the only asset that people flaunt and covet. In a complicated society, people compete in many leagues, not all of them dominated by plutocrats. Bell added a fourth canon to Veblens list: conspicuous outrage. Most of us depend on the approval of others. We need the favor of bosses, teachers, parents, clients, customers, or prospective in-laws, and that requires a certain measure of respect and unobtrusiveness. Aggressive nonconformity is an advertisement that one is so confident in ones station or abilities that one can jeopardize the good will of others without ending up ostracized', 'see all my wealth '),
(458, 85, 8, 'sees the mind as a product of nature Cognitive closure should be true if we know what we are talking about. Still, one might have thought that the hypothesis was merely a daydream, a logical possibility that could go no further than late-night dorm-room bull sessions. McGinns attempt to identify the humanly unsolvable problems is an advance. Even better, we can glimpse why certain problems are beyond our ken. A recurring theme of this book is that the mind owes its power to its syntactic, compositional, combinatorial abilities (Chapter 2). Our complicated ideas are built out of simpler ones, and the meaning of the whole is determined by the meanings of the parts and the meanings of the relations that connect them: part-of-a-whole, example-of-a-category, thing-at-a-place, actor-exerting-force, cause-of-an-effect, mind-holdinga- belief. These logical and lawlike connections provide the meanings of sentences in everyday speech and, through analogies and metaphors, lend their structures to the esoteric contents of science and mathematics, where they are assembled into bigger and bigger theoretical edifices (see Chapter 5). We grasp matter as molecules, atoms, and quarks; life as DNA, genes, and a tree of organisms; change as position, momentum, and force; mathematics as symbols and operations. All are assemblies of elements composed according to laws, in which the properties of the whole are predictable from the properties of the parts and the way they are combined. Even when scientists grapple with seamless continua and dynamical processes, they couch their theories in words, equations, and computer simulations, combinatorial media that mesh with the workings of the mind. We are lucky that parts of the world behave as lawful interactions among simpler elements. But there is something peculiarly holistic and everywhere-at-omce and nowhere-at-all and all-at-the-same-time about the problems of philosophy. Sentience is not a combination of brain events or computational states: how a red-sensitive neuron gives rise to the subjective feel of redness is not a whit less mysterious than how the whole brain gives rise to the entire stream of consciousness. The "I" is not a combination of body parts or brain states or bits of information, but a unity of selfness over time, a single locus that is nowhere in particular. Free will is not a causal chain of events and states, by definition. Although the combinatorial aspect of meaning has been worked out (how words or ideas combine into the meanings of sentences or propositions), the core of meaning the simple act of referring to something remains a puzzle, because it The Meaning of Life 565 stands strangely apart from any causal connection between the thing referred to and the person referring. Knowledge, too, throws up the paradox that knowers are acquainted with things that have never impinged upon them. Our thoroughgoing perplexity about the enigmas of consciousness, self, will, and knowledge may come from a mismatch between the very nature of these problems and the computational apparatus that natural selection has fitted us with. If these conjectures are correct, our psyche would present us with the ultimate tease. The most undeniable thing there is, our own awareness, would be forever beyond our conceptual grasp. But if our minds are part of nature, that is to be expected, even welcomed. The natural world evokes our awe by the specialized designs of its creatures and their parts. We dont poke fun at the eagle for its clumsiness on the ground or fret that the eye is not very good at hearing, because we know that a design can excel at one challenge only by compromising at others.

(459, 86, 8, 'short-term memory to thread the proposition V» together. This dynamic processor, called a recursive transition network, is especially plausible for sentence understanding, because we hear and read words one at a time rather than inhaling an entire sentence at once. We also seem to chew our eomplex thoughts piece by piece rather swallowing or regurgitating them whole, and that suggests that the mind is equipped with a recursive proposition-cruncher for thoughts, not just for sentences. The psychologists Michael Jordan and Jeff Elman have built networks whose output units send out connections that loop back into a set of short-term memory units, triggering a-new cycle of activation flow. That looping design provides a glimpse of how iterative information processing might be implemented in neural networks, but it is not enough to interpret or assemble structured propositions. More recently, there have been attempts to combine a looping network with a propositional network to implement a kind of recursive transition network out of pieces of connectoplasm. These attempts show that unless neural networks are specially assembled into a recursive processor, they cannot handle our recursive thoughts. 126 I he human mind must be given credit for one more cognitive feat that is difficult to wring out of connectoplasm, and therefore difficult to explain by associationism. Neural networks easily implement a fuzzy logic in which everything is a kind-of something to some degree. To be sure, many common-sense concepts really are fuzzy at their edges and have no clear definitions. The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein offered the example of "a game," whose exemplars (jigsaw puzzles, roller derby, curling, Dungeons and Dragons, cockfighting, and so on) have nothing in common, and earlier I gave you two others, "bachelor" and "vegetable." The members of a fuzzy category lack a single defining feature; they overlap in many! features, much like the members of a family or the strands of a rope, none of which runs the entire length. In the comic strip Bloom County, Opus the Penguin, temporarily amnesic, objects when he is told he is a bird. Birds are svelte and aerodynamic, he points out; he is not. Birds can fly; he cannot. Birds can sing; his performance of "Yesterday" left his listeners gagging. Opus suspects he is really Bullwinkle the Moose. So even concepts like "bird" seem to be organized not around necessary and sufficient conditions but around prototypical members. If you look up bird in the dictionary, it will be illustrated not with a penguin but with Joe Bird, typically a sparrow. Experiments in cognitive psychology have shown that people are bigots about birds, other animals, vegetables, and tools. People share a stereotype, project it to all the members of a category, recognize the stereotype more quickly than the nonconformists, and even claim to have seen the stereotype when all they really saw were examples similar to it. These responses can be predicted by tallying up the properties that a member shares with other members of the category: the more birdy properties, the better the bird. An auto-associator presented with examples from a category pretty much does the same thing, because it computes correlations among properties. Thats a reason to believe that parts of human memory are wired something like an auto-associator. But there must be more to the mind than that. People are not always fuzzy. We laugh at Opus because a part of us knows that he really is a bird. We may agree on the prototype of a grandmother the kindly, grayhaired septuagenarian dispensing blueberry muffins or chicken soup (depending on whose stereotype were talking about) but at the same time we have no', 'short-term memory to thread '),
(460, 87, 8, 'So even if children acquiesce to a parents rewards, punishments, examples, and exhortations for the time being because they are smaller and have no choice, they should not, according to the theory, allow their personalities to be shaped by these tactics. Trivers went out on a limb with that prediction. The idea that parents shape their children is so ingrained that most people dont even realize it is a testable hypothesis and not a self-evident truth. The hypothesis has now been tested, and the outcome is one of the most surprising in the history of psychology. Personalities differ in at least five major ways: whether a person is sociable or retiring (extroversion-introversion), whether a person worries constantly or is calm and self-satisfied (neuroticism-stability), whether the person is courteous and trusting or rude and suspicious (agreeableness- antagonism), whether a person is careful or careless (conscientiousness- undirectedness), and whether a person is daring or conforming (openness-nonopenness). Where do these traits come from? If they are genetic, identical twins should share them, even if they were separated at birth, and biological siblings should share them more than adoptive siblings do. If they are a product of socialization by parents, adoptive siblings should share them, and twins and biological siblings should share them more when they grow up in the same home than when they grow up in different homes. Dozens of studies have tested these kinds of predictions on thousands of people in many countries. The studies have looked not only at these personality traits but at actual outcomes in life such as divorce and alcoholism. The results are clear and replicable, and they contain two shockers. One result has become well known. Much of the variation in personality about fifty percent has genetic causes. Identical twins separated at birth are alike; biological siblings raised together are more alike than adopted siblings. That means that the other fifty percent must come from the parents and the home, right? Wrong! Being brought up in one home versus another accounts, at most, forgive percent of the differences among people in personality. Identical twins separated at birth are not only similar; they are virtually as similar as identical twins raised together. Adoptive siblings in the same home are not just different; they are about as different as two children plucked from the population Family Values 449 at random. The biggest influence that parents have on their children is at the moment of conception. (I hasten to add that parents are unimportant only when it comes to differences among them and differences among their grown children. Anything that all normal parents do that affects all children is not measured in these studies. Young children surely need the love, protection, and tutelage of a sane parent. As the psychologist Judith Harris has put it, the studies imply only that children would turn into the same kinds of adults if you left them in their homes and social milieus but switched all the parents around.) No one knows where the other forty-five percent of the variation comes from. Perhaps personality is shaped by unique events impinging on the growing brain: how the fetus lay in the womb, how much maternal blood it diverted, how it was squeezed during birth, whether it was dropped on its head or caught certain viruses in the early years. Perhaps personality is shaped by unique experiences, like being chased by a dog or receiving an act of kindness from a teacher. Perhaps the traits of parents and the traits of children interact in complicated ways, so that two children growing up with the same', 'So even if children '),

An organism that devotes some of its matter and energy to one organ must take it away from another. It must have thinner bones or less muscle or fewer eggs. Organs evolve only when their benefits outweigh their costs. Do you have a Personal Digital Assistant, like the Apple Newton?

Second, they need batteries. Third, they take time to learn to use. Fourth, their sophistication makes simple tasks, like looking up a phone number, slow and cumbersome. I get by with a notebook and a fountain pen. The same disadvantages would face any creature pondering whether to evolve a humanlike brain. First, the brain is bulky. The female pelvis barely accommodates a babys outsize head. That design compromise kills many women during childbirth and requires a pivoting gait that makes women biomechanically less efficient walkers than men. Also, a heavy head bobbing around on a neck makes us more vulnerable to fatal injuries in accidents such as falls. Second, the brain needs energy. Neural tissue is metabolically greedy; our brains take up only two percent of our body weight but consume twenty percent of our energy and nutrients. Third, brains take time to learn to use. We spend much of our lives either being children or caring for children. Fourth, simple tasks can be slow. My first graduate advisor was a mathematical psychologist who wanted to model the transmission of information in the brain by measuring reaction times to loud tones. Theoretically, the neuron-toneuron transmission times should have added up to a few milliseconds. But there were seventy-five milliseconds unaccounted for between stimulus and response "Theres all this cogitation going on, and we just want him to push his finger down," my advisor grumbled. Lower-tech animals can be much quicker; some insects can bite in less than a millisecond. Perhaps this answers the rhetorical question in the sporting equipment ad: The average mans IQ is 107. The average brown trouts IQ is 4. So why cant a man catch a brown trout? Intelligence isnt for everyone, any more than a trunk is, and this should give SETI enthusiasts pause.

The fallacy that intelligence is some exalted ambition of evolution is part of the same fallacy that treats it as a divine essence or wonder tissue or all-encompassing mathematical principle.

Many astronauts are chronically space-sick, because there is no gravitational signal, a rather extreme mismatch between gravity and vision.

Space Cadet Garn made history as the all-time champion upchucker.) Worse, spacecraft interiors do not give the astronauts a world-aligned frame of reference, because the designers figure that without gravity the concepts "floor," "ceiling," and "walls" are meaningless, so they might as well put instruments on all six surfaces. The astronauts, unfortunately, carry their terrestrial brains with them and literally get lost unless they stop and say to themselves, "Im going to pretend that thataway is up, thataway is forward," and so on. It works for a while, but if they look out the window and see terra firma above them, or catch sight of a crewmate floating upside down, a wave of nausea slams them. Space sickness is a concern to NASA, and not only because of the decline in productivity during expensive flight time; you can well imagine the complications of vomiting in zero gravity.

Why on earth or space should a mismatch between vision and gravity or inertia lead, of all things, to nausea? What does up-and-down have to do with the gut? The psychologist Michel Treisman has come up with a plausible though still unproven explanation. Animals vomit to expel toxins they have eaten before the toxins do further harm. Many naturally occurring toxins act on the nervous system. This raises the problem faced by Ingrid Bergman in Notorious: how do you know when you have been poisoned? Your judgment would be addled, but that would affect your judgment about whether your judgment has been addled! More generally, how could a malfunction detector distinguish between the brains malfunctioning and its accurately registering an unusual situation? (Old bumper sticker: "The world is experiencing technical difficulties. Do not adjust your mind.") Gravity, of course, is the most stable, predictable feature of the world. If two parts of the brain have different opinions about it, chances are that one or both is malfunctioning or that the signals they are 266 J getting have been delayed or garbled. The rule would be: if you think gravity is acting up, youve been poisoned; jettison the rest of the poison, now. 1 he mental up-down axis is also a powerful organizer of our sense of shape and form.

The mental representation of a shape how our minds "describe" it does not just reflect its Euclidean geometry, which remains unchanged as a shape is turned. It reflects the geometry relative to our up-down reference frame. Our minds think of Africa as a thing with a fat bit "at the top" and a skinny bit "at the bottom." Change whats at the top and whats at the bottom, and its no longer Africa, even if not a jot of coastline has been altered.

Because networks are advertised as soft, parallel, analogical, biological, and continuous, they have acquired a cuddly connotation and a diverse fan club. But neural networks dont perform miracles, only some logical and statistical operations. The choices of an input representation, of the number of networks, of the wiring diagram chosen for each one, and of the data pathways and control structures that interconnect them explain more about what makes a system smart than do the generic powers of the component connectoplasm. But my main intent is not to show what certain kinds of models cannot do but what the mind can do. The point of this chapter is to give you a feel for the stuff our minds are made of. Thoughts and thinking are no longer ghostly enigmas but mechanical processes that can be studied, and the strengths and weaknesses of different theories can be examined and debated. I find it particularly illuminating to see the shortcomings of the venerable doctrine of the association of ideas, because they highlight the precision, subtlety, complexity, and open-endedness of our everyday thinking. The computational power of human thought has real consequences. It is put to good use in our capacity for love, justice, creativity, literature, music, kinship, law, science, and other activities we will explore in later chapters.

What makes us actually suffer the pain of a toothache or see the blue of the sky as blue? The computational theory of 132 I mind, even with complete neural underpinnings, offers no clear answer. The symbol blue is inscribed, goal states change, some neurons fire; so what? Consciousness has struck many thinkers as not just a problem but almost a miracle: Matter can differ from matter only in form, bulk, density, motion and direction of motion: to which of these, however varied or combined, can consciousness be annexed? To be round or square, to be solid or fluid, to be great or little, to be moved slowly or swiftly one way or another, are modes of material existence, all equally alien from the nature of cogitation.

Marriage arrangements are usually described from the mans point of view, not because the desires of women are irrelevant but because powerful men have usually gotten their way. Men are bigger and stronger because they have been selected to fight one another, and they can form powerful clans because in traditional societies sons stay near their families and daughters move away. The most florid polygynists are always despots, men who could kill without fear of retribution. (According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the man with the most recorded children in history 888 was an emperor of Morocco with the evocative name Moulay Ismail The Bloodthirsty.) The hyperpolygynist not only must fend off the hundreds of men he has deprived of wives, but must oppress his harem. Marriages always have at least a bit of reciprocity, and in most polygynous societies a man may forgo additional wives because of their emotional and financial demands. A despot can keep them imprisoned and terrified. But oddly enough, in a freer society polygyny is not necessarily bad for women. On financial and ultimately on evolutionary grounds, a woman may prefer to share a wealthy husband than to have the undivided attention of a pauper, and may even prefer it on emotional grounds. Laura Betzig summed up the reason: Would you rather be the third wife of John F. Kennedy or the first wife of Bozo the Clown? Cowives often get along, sharing expertise and child-care duties, though jealousies among the subfamilies often erupt, much as in stepfamilies but with more factions and adult players. If marriage were genuinely a free market, then in a polygamous society mens greater demand for a limited supply of partners and their inflexible sexual jealousy would give the advantage to women. Laws enforcing monogamy would work to womens disadvantage. The economist Steven Landsburg explains the market principle, using labor instead of money in his example: Today, when my wife and I argue about who should do the dishes, we start from positions of roughly equal strength. If polygamy were legal, my wife could hint that shes thought about leaving me to many Alan and Cindy down the block and I might end up with dishpan hands. 478 IAntipolygamy laws are a textbook example of the theory of cartels. Producers, initially competitive, gather together in a conspiracy against the public or, more specifically, against their customers. They agree that each firm will restrict its output in an attempt to keep prices high. But a high price invites cheating, in the sense that each firm seeks to expand its own output beyond what is allowable under the agreement. Eventually, the cartel crumbles unless it is enforced by legal sanctions, and even then violations are legion. That story, told in every economics textbook, is also the story of male producers in the romance industry. Initially fiercely competitive, they gather together in a conspiracy against their "customers" the women to whom they offer their hands in marriage. The conspiracy consists of an agreement under which each man restricts his romantic endeavors in an attempt to increase the bargaining position of men in general. But the improved position of men invites cheating, in the sense that each man tries to court more women than allowed under the agreement. The cartel survives only because it is enforced by legal sanctions, and even so violations are legion. Legal monogamy historically has been an agreement between more and less powerful men, not between men and women. Its aim is not so much', 'survive in the bleak '),

Each human emotion mobilizes the mind and body to meet one of the challenges of living and reproducing in the cognitive niche. Some challenges are posed by physical things, and the emotions that deal with them, like disgust, fear, and appreciation of natural beauty, work in straightforward ways. Others are posed by people. The problem in dealing with people is that people can deal back. The emotions that evolved in response to other peoples emotions, like anger, gratitude, shame, and romantic love, are played on a complicated chessboard, and they spawn the passion and intrigue that misleads the Romantic. First lets explore emotions about things, then emotions about people. THE SUBURBAN SAVANNA The expression "a fish out of water" reminds us that every animal is adapted to a habitat. Humans are no exception. We tend to think that animals just go where they belong, like heat-seeking missiles, but the animals must experience these drives as emotions not unlike ours. Some Hotheads 375 places are inviting, calming, or beautiful; others are depressing or scary. The topic in biology called "habitat selection" is, in the case of Homo sapiens, the same as the topic in geography and architecture called "environmental aesthetics": what kinds of places we enjoy being in. Until very recently our ancestors were nomads, leaving a site when they had used up its edible plants and animals. The decision of where to go next was no small matter. Cosmides and Tooby write: Imagine that you are on a camping trip that lasts a lifetime. Having to carry water from a stream and firewood from the trees, one quickly learns to appreciate the advantages of some campsites over others. Dealing with exposure on a daily basis quickly gives one an appreciation for sheltered sites, out of the wind, snow, or rain. For hunter-gatherers, there is no escape from this way of life: no opportunities to pick up food at the grocery store, no telephones, no emergency services, no artificial water supplies, no fuel deliveries, no cages, guns, or animal control officers to protect one from the predatory animals. In these circumstances, ones life depends on the operation of mechanisms that cause one to prefer habitats that provide sufficient food, water, shelter, information, and safety to support human life, and that cause one to avoid those that do not. Homo sapiens is adapted to two habitats. One is the African savanna, in which most of our evolution took place. For an omnivore like our ancestors, the savanna is a hospitable place compared with other ecosystems. Deserts have little biomass because they have little water. Temperate forests lock up much of their biomass in wood. Rainforests or, as they used to be called, jungles place it high in the canopy, relegating omnivores on the ground to being scavengers who gather the bits that fall from above. But the savanna grasslands dotted with clumps of t r e e s - is rich in biomass, much of it in the flesh of large animals, because grass replenishes itself quickly when grazed. And most of the biomass is conveniently placed a meter or two from the ground. Savannas also offer expansive views, so predators, water, and paths can be spotted from afar. Its trees provide shade and an escape from carnivores. Our second-choice habitat is the rest of the world. Our ancestors, after evolving on the African savannas, wandered into almost every nook and cranny of the planet. Some were pioneers who left', 'takes in oxygen. Adrenaline '),
(466, 93, 8, 'The added good will one feels toward kin is doled out according to a feeling that reflects the probability that the kind act will help a relative propagate copies of ones genes. That in turn depends on the nearness of the relative to oneself in the family tree, the confidence one has in that nearness, and the impact of the kindness on the relatives prospects of reproducing (which depends on age and need). So parents love their children above all others, cousins love each other but not as much as siblings do, and so on. Of course, no one crunches genetic and actuarial data and then decides how much to love. Rather, the mental programs for familial love were calibrated in the course of evolution so that love correlated with the probability in the ancestral environment that a loving act would benefit copies of genes for loving acts. You might think this is just the banal observation that blood is thicker than water. But in todays intellectual climate, the observation is a shocking, radical thesis. A Martian who wanted to learn about human interactions from a textbook in social psychology would have no inkling that humans behave any differently to their relatives than to strangers. Some anthropologists have argued that our sense of kinship has nothing to do with biological relatedness. The conventional wisdom of Marxists, academic feminists, and cafe intellectuals embraces some astonishing claims: that the nuclear family of husband, wife, and children is a historical aberration unknown in centuries past and in the non-Western world; that in primitive tribes marriage is uncommon and people are indiscriminately promiscuous and free of jealousy; that throughout history the bride and groom had no say in their marriage; that romantic love was 432 invented by the troubadours of medieval Provence and consisted of the adulterous love of a knight for a married lady; that children used to be thought of as miniature adults; that in olden times children died so often that mothers were unaffected by the loss; that concern for ones children is a recent invention. These beliefs are false. Blood really is thicker than water, and no aspect of human existence is untouched by that part of our psychology. Families are important in all societies, and their core is a mother and her biological children. All societies have marriage. A man and a> woman enter a publicly acknowledged alliance whose primary goal is children; the man has a "right" of exclusive sexual access to the woman; and they both are obligated to invest in their children. The details vary, often according to the patterns of blood relationships in the society. Generally, when men can be confident that they are the fathers of their wives children, nuclear families form, usually near the husbands extended kin. In the smaller number of societies where men are not so confident (for example, when they are away for long stretches of military service or farm labor), families live near the mothers kin, and childrens principal male benefactors are their closest blood relatives, their maternal uncles. Even then, biological fatherhood is recognized and valued. Both sides of the extended family take an interest in the marriage and the children, and the children feel solidarity with both sides, even when the official rules of descent recognize only one side (as in our own surnames, which are reckoned according to the fathers family). Women fare better when they stay near their relatives and the men move around, because they are surrounded by fathers, brothers, and uncles who can come to their aid in disputes with their husbands.

(467, 94, 8, 'The equation of youth and beauty is often blamed on Americas being obsessed with youth, but by that reasoning every culture is obsessed with youth. If anything, contemporary America is less youthoriented. The age of Playboy models has increased over the decades, and in most times and places women in their twenties have been considered over the hill. Mens looks dont decline as quickly when they age, not because of a double standard in our society but because mens fertility doesnt decline as quickly when they age. At puberty a girls hips become wider because her pelvis grows and because fat is deposited on her hips, a reserve of calories available to supply the body during pregnancy. The ratio of waist size to hip size decreases in most fertile women to between .67 and .80, whereas the ratio for most men, children, and postmenopausal women is between .80 and .95. Among women, a low waist-to-hip ratio has been found to correlate with youth, health, fertility, not being pregnant, and never having been pregnant. The psychologist Devendra Singh has shown photographs and computer-generated pictures of female bodies of different sizes and shapes to hundreds of people of various ages, sexes, and cultures. Everyone finds a ratio of .70 or lower the most attractive. The ratio captures the old idea of the hourglass figure, the wasp waist, and the 36-24-36 ideal measurements. Singh also measured the ratio in Playboy centerfolds and winners of beauty contests over seven decades. Their weight has gone down, but their waist-to-hip ratio has stayed the same. Even most of the Upper Paleolithic Venus figurines, carved tens of thousands of years ago, have the right proportions. The geometry of beauty once was an indicator of youth, health, and nonpregnancy, but it no longer has to be. Women today have fewer babies, have them later, are less exposed to the elements, and are better nourished and less disease-ridden than their ancestors. They can look 486 like an ancestral teenager well into middle age. Women also have a technology to simulate and exaggerate the clues to youth, femaleness, and health: eye makeup (to enlarge the eyes), lipstick, eyebrow plucking (to reduce the appearance of a masculine brow ridge), makeup (to exploit the shape-from-shading mechanism of Chapter 4), products that increase the luster, thickness, and color of hair, bras and clothing that simulate young breasts, and hundreds of potions alleged to keep the skin looking young. Dieting and exercise can keep the waist thinner and the waist-to-hip ratio lower, and an illusion can be engineered with bodices, corsets, hoops, crinolines, bustles, girdles, pleats, tapering, and wide belts. Womens fashion has never embraced bulky cummerbunds. Outside the scientific literature, more has been written about womens weight than any other aspect of beauty. In the West, women in pictures have weighed less and less over the past decades. That has been taken as evidence for the arbitrariness of beauty and for the oppression of women, who are expected to conform to these standards no matter how unreasonable. Slender models are commonly blamed for anorexia nervosa in teenage girls, and a recent book was called Fat Is a Feminist Issue. But weight may be the least important part of beauty. Singh found that very fat women and very thin women are judged less attractive (and in fact they are less fertile), but there is a range of weights considered attractive, and shape (waist-to-hip ratio) is more important than size. The hoopla about thinness applies more to women who pose for other women than to women who pose for men. Twiggy and Kate Moss', 'The equation of youth '),

I possess only my personal sense of dignity. My life has been reduced to nothing by an intolerable insult. Therefore, I have nothing to lose except my life, which is nothing, so I trade my life for yours, as your life is favoured. The exchange is in my favour, so I shall not only kill you, but I shall kill many of you, and at the same time rehabilitate myself in the eyes of the group of which I am a member, even though I might be killed in the process. The amok syndrome is an extreme instance of the puzzle of the human emotions. Exotic at first glance, upon scrutiny they turn out to be universal; quintessentially irrational, they are tightly interwoven with abstract thought and have a cold logic of their own. UNIVERSAL PASSION A familiar tactic for flaunting ones worldhness is to inform listeners that some culture lacks an emotion we have or has an emotion we lack. Allegedly the Utku-Inuit Eskimos have no word for anger and do not feel the emotion. Tahitians supposedly do not recognize guilt, sadness, longing, or loneliness; they describe what we would call grief as fatigue, sicikness, or Hotheads 365 bodily distress. Spartan mothers were said to smile upon hearing that their sons died in combat. In Latin cultures, machismo reigns, whereas the Japanese are driven by a fear of shaming the family. In interviews on language I have been asked, Who but the Jews would have a word, naches, for luminous pride in a childs accomplishments? And does it not say something profound about the Teutonic psyche that the German language has the word Schadenfreude, pleasure in anothers misfortunes? Cultures surely differ in how often their members express, talk about, and act on various emotions. But that says nothing about what their people feel. The evidence suggests that the emotions of all normal members of our species are played on the same keyboard. The most accessible signs of emotions are candid facial expressions. In preparing The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, Darwin circulated a questionnaire to people who interacted with aboriginal populations on five continents, including populations that had had little contact with Europeans. Urging them to answer in detail and from observation rather than memory, Darwin asked how the natives expressed astonishment, shame, indignation, concentration, grief, good spirits, contempt, obstinacy, disgust, fear, resignation, sulkiness, guilt, slyness, jealousy, and "yes" and "no." For example: (5.) When in low spirits, are the corners of the mouth depressed, and the inner corner of the eyebrows raised by that muscle which the French call the "Grief muscle"? The eyebrow in this state becomes slightly oblique, with a little swelling at the inner end; and the forehead is transversely wrinkled in the middle part, but not across the whole breadth, as when the eyebrows are raised in surprise. Darwin summed up the responses: "The same state of mind is expressed throughout the world with remarkable uniformity; and this fact is in itself interesting as evidence of the close similarity in bodily structure and mental disposition of all the races of mankind." Though Darwin may have biased his informants with leading questions, contemporary research has borne out his conclusion.

Slavery, harem-holding despots, colonial conquest, blood feuds, women as property, institutionalized racism and anti-Semitism, child labor, apartheid, fascism, Stalinism, Leninism, and war have vanished from expanses of the world that had suffered them for decades, centuries, or millennia. The homicide rates in the most vicious American urban jungles are twenty times lower than in many foraging societies. Modern Britons are twenty times less likely to be murdered than their medieval ancestors. If the brain has not changed over the centuries, how can the human condition have improved? Part of the answer, I think, is that literacy, knowledge, and the exchange of ideas have undermined some kinds of exploitation. Its not that people have a well of goodness that moral exhortations can tap. Its that information can be framed in a way that makes exploiters look like hypocrites or fools. One of our baser instincts claiming authority on a pretext of beneficence and competence can be cunningly turned on the others. When everyone sees graphic representations of suffering, it is no longer possible to claim that no harm is being done. When a victim gives a first-person account in words the victimizer might use, its harder to maintain that the victims are a lesser kind of being. When a speaker is shown to be echoing the words of his enemy or of a past speaker whose policies led to disaster, his authority can crumble. When peaceable neighbors are described, its harder to insist that war is inevitable. When Martin Luther King said, "I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal," he made it impossible for segregationists to maintain they were patriots without looking like charlatans. And as I mentioned at the outset, though conflict is a human universal, so are efforts to reduce it. The human mind occasionally catches a Family Values 519 glimmering of the brute economic fact that often adversaries can both come out ahead by dividing up the surplus created by their laying down their arms. Even some of the Yanomamo see the futility of their ways and long for a means to break the cycle of vengeance. People throughout history have invented ingenious technologies that turn one part of the mind against another and eke increments of civility from a human nature that was not selected for niceness: rhetoric, exposes, mediation, face-saving measures, contracts, deterrence, equal opportunity, mediation, courts, enforceable laws, monogamy, limits on economic inequality, abjuring vengeance, and many others. Utopian theoreticians ought to be humble in the face of this practical wisdom. It is likely to remain more effective than "cultural" proposals to make over childrearing, language, and the media, and "biological" proposals to scan the brains and genes of gang members for aggression markers and to hand out antiviolence pills in the ghettos. Tenzin Gyatso, the Dalai Lama of Tibet, was identified at the age of two as the fourteenth reincarnation of the Buddha of Compassion, Holy Lord, Gentle Glory, Eloquent, Compassionate, Learned Defender of the Faith, Ocean of Wisdom. He was taken to Lhasa and brought up by doting monks, who tutored him in philosophy, medicine, and metaphysics. In 1950 he became the spiritual and secular leader in exile of the Tibetan people.

Since there is usually only one species per genus in a locality, their categories usually match the biologists "species" as well. Every folk genus belongs to a single "life form," such as mammals, birds, mushrooms, herbs, insects, or reptiles. The life forms are in turn either animals or plants. People override appearances when classifying living things; for example, they lump frogs and tadpoles. They use their classes to reason about how animals work, such as who can breed with whom. One of Darwins best arguments for evolution was that it explained why living things are hierarchically grouped. The tree of life is a family tree. The members of a species seem to share an essence because they are descendants of a common ancestor that passed it on. Species fall into groups within groups because they diverged from even earlier common ancestors. Embryonic and internal features are more sensible criteria than surface appearance because they better reflect degree of relatedness. Darwin had to fight his contemporaries intuitive essentialism because, taken to an extreme, it implied that species could not change. A reptile has a reptilian essence and can no more evolve into a bird than the number seven can evolve into an even number. As recently as the 1940s, the philosopher Mortimer Adler argued that just as there can be no three-and-a-half-sided triangle, there can be nothing intermediate between an animal and a human, so humans could not have evolved. Darwin pointed out that species are populations, not ideal types, with members that vary; in the past they could have shaded into in-between forms. Today we have gone to the other extreme, and in modern academic life "essentialist" is just about the worst thing you can call someone. In the sciences, essentialism is tantamount to creationism. In the humanities, the label implies that the person subscribes to insane beliefs such as that the sexes are not socially constructed, there are universal human emotions, a real world exists, and so on. And in the social sciences, "essentialism" has joined "reductionism," "determinism," and "reification" as a term of abuse hurled at anyone who tries to explain human 326 J thought and behavior rather than redescribe it. I think it is unfortunate that "essentialism" has become an epithet, because at heart it is just the ordinary human curiosity to find out what makes natural things work. Essentialism is behind the success of chemistry, physiology, and genetics, and even today biologists routinely embrace the essentialisfc heresy when they work on the Human Genome Project (but everyone has a different genome!) or open up Grays Anatomy (but bodies vary!). How deeply rooted is essentialist thinking? The psychologists Frank Keil, Susan Gelman, and Henry Wellman have taken the philosophers thought experiments about natural kinds and given them to children. Doctors take a tiger, bleach its fur, and sew on a mane. Is it a lion or a tiger? Seven-year-olds say its still a tiger, but five-year-olds say its now a lion. This finding, taken at face value, suggests that older children are essentialists about animals but younger ones are not. (At no age are children essentialists about artifacts if you make a coffeepot look like a birdfeeder, children, like adults, say it just is a birdfeeder.) But with deeper probing, one can find evidence for essentialist intuitions about living things even in preschoolers. Five-year-olds deny that an animal can be made to cross the deeper boundary into plants or artifacts. For example, they say that a porcupine that looks as if it has been turned', 'the local plants and '),
(471, 98, 8, 'the SETI enthusiasts are reasoning from a pre-scientific folk belief. Centuries-old religious dogma, the Victorian ideal of progress, and modern secular humanism all lead people to misunderstand evolution as an internal yearning or unfolding toward greater complexity, climaxing in the appearance of man. The pressure builds up, and intelligence emerges like popcorn in a pan. The religious doctrine was called the Great Chain of Being amoeba to monkey to man and even today many scientists thoughtlessly use words like "higher" and "lower" life forms and the evolutionary "scale" and "ladder." The parade of primates, from gangly-armed gibbon through stoop-shouldered caveman to upright modern man, has become an icon of pop culture, and we all understand what someone means when she says she turned down a date because the guy is not very evolved. In science fiction like H. G. Wells The Time Machine, episodes of Star Trek, and stories from Boys Life, the momentum is extrapolated to our descendants, shown as bald, varicose-veined, bulbous-brained, spindly-bodied homunculi. In The Planet of the Apes and other stories, after we have blown ourselves to smithereens or choked in our pollutants, apes or dolphins rise to the occasion and take on our mantle. Drake expressed these assumptions in a letter to Science defending SETI against the eminent biologist Ernst Mayr. Mayr had noted that only one of the fifty million species on earth had developed civilizations, so the probability that life on a given planet would include an intelligent species might very well be small. Drake replied: The first species to develop intelligent civilizations will discover that it is the only such species. Should it be surprised? Someone must be first, and being first says nothing about how many other species had or have the potential to evolve into intelligent civilizations, or may do so in the future Similarly, among many civilizations, one will be the first, and temporarily the only one, to develop electronic technology. How else 152 could it be? The evidence does suggest that planetary systems need to exist in sufficiently benign circumstances for a few billion years for a technology-using species to evolve. To see why this thinking runs so afoul of the modern theory of evolution, consider an analogy. The human brain is an exquisitely complex organ that evolved only once. The elephants trunk, which can stack logs, uproot trees, pick up a dime, remove thorns, powder the elephant with dust, siphon water, serve as a snorkel, and scribble with a pencil, is another complex organ that evolved only once. The brain and the trunk are products of the same evolutionary force, natural selection. Imagine an astronomer on the Planet of the Elephants defending SETT, the Search for Extraterrestrial Trunks: The first species to develop a trunk will discover that it is the only such species. Should it be surprised:1 Someone must be first, and being first says nothing about how many other species had or have the potential to evolve trunks, or may do so in the future.Similarly, among many trunk-bearing species, one will be the first, and temporarily the only one, to powder itself with dust. The evidence does suggest that planetary systems need to exist in sufficiently benign circumstances for a few billion years for a trunk-using species to evolve.This reasoning strikes us as cockeyed because the elephant is assuming that evolution did not just produce the trunk in a species on this planet but was striving to produce it in some lucky species, each waiting and hoping.

Don Juans do not inspire admiration, especially in women, though they may inspire envy in men, a different and not always welcome reaction. Symons remarks, Human males appear to be so constituted that they resist learning not to desire variety despite impediments such as Christianity and the doctrine of sin; Judaism and the doctrine of mensch; social science and the doctrines of repressed homosexuality and psychosexual immaturity; evolutionary theories of monogamous pair-bonding; cultural and legal traditions that support and glorify monogamy; the fact that the desire for variety is virtually impossible to satisfy; the time and energy, and the innumerable kinds of risk physical and emotional that variety-seeking entails; and the obvious potential rewards of learning to be sexually satisfied with one woman. A wandering eye, learned or not, is not the only component of a mans mind. Though desire often leads to behavior, it often does not, because, 476 other desires are stronger or because tactics of self-control (see Chapter 6) have been put into effect. Mens sexual tastes can be calibrated and overruled depending on the mans attractiveness, the availability of partners, and his assessment of the costs of a dalliance. HUSBANDS AND WIVES In evolutionary terms, a man who has a short-term liaison is betting that his illegitimate child will survive without his help or is counting on a cuckolded husband to bring it up as his own. For the man who can afford it, a surer way to maximize progeny is to seek several wives and invest in all their children. Men should want many wives, not just many sex partners. And in fact, men in power have allowed polygyny in more than eighty percent of human cultures. Jews practiced it until Christian times and outlawed it only in the tenth century. Mormons encouraged it until it was outlawed by the U.S. government in the late nineteenth century, and even today there are thought to be tens of thousands of clandestine polygynous marriages in Utah and other western states. Whenever polygyny is allowed, men seek additional wives and the means to attract them. Wealthy and prestigious men have more than one wife; neer-do-wells have none. Typically a man who has been married for some time seeks a younger wife. The senior wife remains his confidante and partner and runs the household; the junior one becomes his sexual interest. In foraging societies wealth cannot accumulate, but a few fierce men, skilled leaders, and good hunters may have two to ten wives. With the invention of agriculture and massive inequality, polygyny can reach ridiculous proportions. Laura Betzig has documented that in civilization after civilization, despotic men have implemented the ultimate male fantasy: a harem of hundreds of nubile women, closely guarded (often by eunuchs) so no other man can touch them. Similar arrangements have popped up in India, China, the Islamic world, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Americas. King Solomon had a thousand concubines. Boman emperors called them slaves, and medieval European kings called them serving maids. Polyandry, by comparison, is vanishingly rare. Men occasionally share a wife in environments so harsh that a man cannot survive without a woman, but the arrangement collapses when conditions improve. Eskimos have sporadically had polyandrous marriages, but the co-husbands Family Values 477 are always jealous and one often murders the other.

Is this any way to build an intelligent organism? Where do these powerful motives come from? Many animals are moved by pointless decorations and rituals, and the selective causes are no longer mysterious. Here is the key idea. Creatures differ in their ability to hurt and help others. Some are stronger or fiercer or more poisonous; some have better genes or more largesse. These potent creatures want everyone to know they are potent, and the creatures they can impinge on also want to know which ones are potent. But it is impossible for every creature to probe every other ones DNA, muscle mass, biochemical composition, ferocity, and so on. So the consequential creatures advertise their worth with a signal. Unfortunately, the inconsequential creatures can counterfeit the signal and reap the 494 benefits, debasing its value to everyone else. The race is on for the consequential creatures to cook up a display that is hard to counterfeit, for the less consequential ones to become better counterfeiters, and for the third parties to sharpen their powers of discrimination. Like paper currency, the signals are inimitably gaudy and intrinsically worthless, but are treated as if they were valuable and are valuable because everyone treats them that way. The precious stuff behind the displays can be divided into dominance who can hurt you and status who can help you. They often go together, because people who can hurt you can also help you by their ability to hurt others. But its convenient to look at them separately. .Most people have heard of the dominance hierarchies, pecking orders, and alpha males that are widespread in the animal kingdom. Animals of the same species dont fight to the death every time they contest something of value. They have a ritualized fight or a show of arms or a staring match, and one backs down. Konrad Lorenz and other early ethologists thought that gestures of surrender helped preserve the species against internecine bloodshed, and that humans were in peril because we lost the gestures. But that idea comes from the fallacy that animals evolve to benefit the species. It cannot explain why a truculent mutant that never surrendered and that killed surrenderers would not walk over the competition and soon characterize the species. The biologists John Maynard Smith and Geoffrey Parker came up with a better explanation by modeling how the different aggressive strategies that animals might adopt would stack up against each other and against themselves. Fighting every contest to the bitter end is a poor strategy for an animal, because chances are its adversary has evolved to do the same thing. A fight is costly to the loser, because it will be injured or dead and hence worse off than if it had relinquished the prize from the start. It also can be costly to the victor because he may sustain injuries in the course of victory. Both parties would have done better if they had assessed who was likely to win beforehand and if the underdog simply conceded.

Pondering large letters activated the parts of the cortex representing the periphery of the visual field; pondering small letters activated the parts representing the fovea. Images really do seem to be laid across the cortical surface. Could the activation be just a spillover of activity from other parts of the brain, where the real computation is being done? The psychologist Martha Farah showed that it isnt. She tested a womans ability to form mental images before and after surgery that removed her visual cortex in one hemisphere. After the surgery, her mental images shrank to half their normal width. Mental images live in the visual cortex; indeed, parts of images take up parts of cortex, just as parts of scenes take up parts of pictures. Still, an image is not an instant replay. It lacks that pungency and tang, though not because it has been bleached or watered down: imagining red is not like seeing pink. And curiously, in the PET studies the mental image sometimes caused more activation of the visual cortex than a real display, not less. Visual images, though they share brain areas with perception, are somehow different, and perhaps that is not surprising. Donald Symons notes that reactivating a visual experience may well have benefits, but it also has costs: the risk of confusing imagination with reality.

JVnowing where mental images are says little about what they are or how they work. Are mental images really patterns of pixels in a 2V2-D array (or patterns of active neurons in a cortical map)? If they are, how do we think with them, and what would make imagery different from any other form of thought? Lets compare an array or sketch to its rival as a model of imagery, symbolic propositions in mentalese (similar to geon models and to semantic networks). The array is on the left, the prepositional model on the right. The diagram collapses many propositions, like "A bear has a head" and "The bear has the size XL," into a single network. The array is straightforward. Each pixel represents a small piece of surface or boundary, period; anything more global or abstract is only implicit in the pattern of filled pixels. The prepositional representation is quite different. First, it is schematic, filled with qualitative relations like "attached to"; not every detail of the geometry is represented. Second, the spatial properties are factored apart and listed explicitly. Shape (the arrangement of an objects parts or geons), size, location, and orientation get their own symbols, and each can be looked up independently of the others. Third, propositions mix spatial information, like parts and their positions, with conceptual information, like bearhood and membership in the carnivore class.

When flipping through a magazine I once caught sight of a headline about anti-semitic cameras (they were semi-antique). There are bottlenecks constricting the flow of information from inside the person as well as from outside. When we try to retrieve a memory, the items drip into awareness one at a time, often with agonizing delays if the information is old or uncommon. Ever since Plato invoked the metaphor of soft wax, psychologists have assumed that the neural medium must be inherently resistant to retaining information, fading with time unless the information is pounded in. But the brain can record indelible memories, such as the content of shocking news and a few of the details of the time and place at which one hears it. So the neural medium itself is not necessarily to blame. The psychologist John Anderson has reverse-engineered human memory retrieval, and has shown that the limits of memory are not a byproduct of a mushy storage medium. As programmers like to say, "Its not a bug, its a feature." In an optimally designed information-retrieval system, an item should be recovered only when the relevance of the item outweighs the cost of retrieving it. Anyone who has used a computerized library retrieval system quickly comes to rue the avalanche of titles spilling across the screen. A human expert, despite our allegedly feeble powers of retrieval, vastly outperforms any computer in locating a piece of information from its content. When I need to find articles on ia topic in an unfamiliar field, I dont use the library computer; I send email to a pal in the field. Thinking Machines 143 What would it mean for an information-retrieval system to be optimally designed? It should cough up the information most likely to be useful at the time of the request. But how could that be known in advance? The probabilities could be estimated, using general laws about what kinds of information are most likely to be needed. If such laws exist, we should be able to find them in information systems in general, not just human memory; for example, the laws should be visible in the statistics of books requested at a library or the files retrieved in a computer. Information scientists have discovered several of these laws. A piece of information that has been requested many times in the past is more likely to be needed now than a piece that has been requested only rarely. A piece that has been requested recently is more likely to be needed now than a piece that has not been requested for a while. An optimal information-retrieval system should therefore be biased to fetch frequently and recently encountered items. Anderson notes that that is exactly what human memory retrieval does: we remember common and recent events better than rare and long-past events. He found four other classic phenomena in memory research that meet the optimal design criteria independently established for computer information-retrieval systems. A third notable feature of access-consciousness is the emotional coloring of experience. We not only register events but register them as pleasurable or painful. That makes us take steps to have more of the former and less of the latter, now and in the future. None of this is a mystery. Computationally speaking, representations trigger goal states, which in turn trigger information-gathering, problem-solving, and behaviorselecting demons that calculate how to attain, shun, or modify the charged situation.', 'the Worlds Worst Coffee.

Thus he (or she) should identify with his parents, who have aligned their interests with his, and should resist changes to the status quo, which has always served him well. He should also learn how best to wield the power that fate has granted him. In sum, a first-born should be a conservative and a bully. Second-born children have to cope in a world that contains this obsequious martinet. Since they cannot get their way with thuggery and toadyism, they must cultivate the opposite strategies. They should become appeasers and cooperators. And with less at stake in the status quo, they should be receptive to change. (These dynamics depend, too, on the innate components of the personalities of the siblings and on their sex, size, and spacing; your mileage may vary.) Later-boms have to be flexible for another reason. Parents invest in 454 I the children who show the most promise of success in the world. The first-born has staked a claim in whatever personal and technical skills she is best at. Theres no point in a later-born competing on that turf; any success would have to come at the expense of the older and more experienced sibling, and he (or she) would be forcing his parents to pick a winner, with daunting odds against him. Instead, he should find a different niche in which to excel. That gives his parents an opportunity to diversify their investments, because he complements his older siblings skills in competition outside the family. Siblings in a family exaggerate their differences for the same reason that species in an ecosystem evolve into different forms: each niche supports a single occupant. Family therapists have discussed these dynamics for decades, but is there any hard evidence? Sulloway analyzed data on 120,000 people from 196 adequately controlled studies of birth order and personality. As he predicted, first-borns are less open (more conforming, traditional, and closely identified with parents), more conscientious (more responsible, achievement-oriented, serious, and organized), more antagonistic (less agreeable, approachable, popular, and easygoing), and more neurotic (less well-adjusted, more anxious). They are also more extroverted (more assertive, more leaderly), though the evidence is cloudy because they are more serious, which makes them seem more introverted. Family politics affects not only what people say in paper-and-pencil tests but how they act in the world when playing for high stakes. Sulloway analyzed biographical data from 3,894 scientists who had voiced opinions on radical scientific revolutions (such as the Copernican revolution and Darwinism), 893 members of the French National Convention during the Terror of 1793-1794, more than seven hundred protagonists in the Protestant Reformation, and the leaders of sixty-two American reform movements such as the abolition of slavery. In each of these shake-ups, later-boms were more likely to support the revolution, first-borns were more likely to be reactionary. The effects are not byproducts of family size, family attitudes, social class, or other confounding factors. When evolutionary theory was first proposed and still incendiary, later-borns were ten times as likely to support it as first-borns. Other alleged causes of radicalism, such as nationality and social class, have only minor effects. (Darwin himself, for example, was upper-class but later-born.) Later-born scientists are also less specialized, trying their hands in a greater number of scientific fields. If personality is an adaptation, why should people carry the strategies Family Values 455 that served them in the rumpus room right into adulthood?

Another is that tactics like assertiveness and conservatism are skills like any other. As a young person invests more and more in honing them, she becomes increasingly loath to retrace the learning curve to cultivate new strategies for dealing with people. The discovery that children brought up in the same family are no more similar than they would be if they had been brought up on different planets shows how poorly we understand the development of personality. All we know is that cherished ideas about the influence of parents are wrong. The most promising hypotheses, I suspect, will come from recognizing that childhood is a jungle and that the first problem children face in life is how to hold their own among siblings and peers. The relationship between a brother and a sister has an added twist: one is male, one is female, and those are the ingredients of a sexual relationship. People have sex with and marry those with whom they interact the most their co-workers, the girl or boy next door and the people most like themselves those of the same class, religion, race, and appearance. The forces of sexual attraction should pull siblings together like magnets. Even if familiarity breeds some contempt and only a tiny fraction of siblings hit it off, there should be millions of brothers and sisters wanting to have.sex and get married. There are virtually none. Not in our society, not in any well-studied human society, not in most animals in the wild. (Prepubertal children sometimes engage in sexual play; Im talking about real intercourse between mature siblings.) Do brothers and sisters avoid copulating because their parents discourage it? Almost certainly not. Parents try to socialize their children to be more affectionate with each other ("Go ahead kiss your sister!"), not less. And if they did discourage sex, it would be the only case in all of human experience in which a sexual prohibition worked. Teenage brothers and sisters do not sneak off for trysts in parks and the back seats of cars. The incest taboo a public prohibition against sex or marriage between close relatives has been an obsession of anthropology for a 456 J century, but it does not explain what keeps siblings apart. Avoiding incest is universal; taboos against incest are not. And most incest taboos are not about sex within the nuclear family. Some are about sex with fiotive kin and merely enforce sexual jealousy. For example, polygynous men may pass laws to keep their sons away from their junior wives, officially the sons "stepmothers." As we have seen, most taboos prohibit marriage (not sex) between more distant kin, such as cousins, and are ploys that rulers use to prevent wealth from accumulating in rival families. Sometimes sex among family members falls under the umbrella of more general codes against incest, but nowhere is it the target. Brothers and sisters simply dont find each other appealing a$ sexual partners. That is an understatement: the thought makes them acutely uncomfortable or fills them with disgust. (People who grew up without siblings of the opposite sex do not understand the emotion.) Freud claimed that the strong emotion is itself proof of an unconscious desire, especially when a male claims revulsion at the thought of coitus with his mother. By that reasoning we may conclude that people have an unconscious desire to eat dog feces and to stick needles in their eyes. Repugnance at sex with a sibling is so robust in humans and other long-lived, mobile vertebrates that it is', 'their parents but compete '),
(478, 105, 8, 'these elementary concepts may be combined into more and more complex ideas. The discovery of portions of the vocabulary and syntax of mentalese is a vindication of Leibniz "remarkable thought": "that a kind of alphabet of human thoughts can be worked out and that everything can be discovered and judged by comparison of the letters of this alphabet and an analysis of the words made from them." And the discovery that the elements of mentalese are based on places and projectiles has implications for both where the language of thought came from and how we put it to use in modern times. Other primates may not think about stories, inheritances, meetings, and traffic lights, but they do think about rocks, sticks, and burrows. Evolutionary change often works by copying body parts and tinkering with the copy. For example, insects mouth parts are modified legs. A similar process may have given us our language of thought. Suppose ancestral circuits for reasoning about space and force were copied, the copys connections to the eyes and muscles were severed, and references to the physical world were bleached out. The circuits could serve as a scaffolding whose slots are filled with symbols for more abstract concerns like states, possessions, ideas, and desires. The circuits would retain their 356 computational abilities, continuing to reckon about entities being in one state at a time, shifting from state to state, and overcoming entities with opposite valence. When the new, abstract domain has a logical structure that mirrors objects in motion a traffic light has one color at a time but flips between them; contested social interactions are determined by the stronger of two wills the old circuits can do useful inferential work. They divulge their ancestry as space- and force-simulators by the metaphors they invite, a kind of vestigial cognitive organ. Are there any reasons to believe that this is how our language of thought evolved? A few. Chimpanzees, and presumably their common ancestor with our species, are curious manipulators of objects. When they are trained to use symbols or gestures, they can make them stand for the event of going to a place or putting an object in a location. The psychologist David Premack has shown that chimpanzees can isolate causes. Given a pair of before-and-after pictures, like an apple and a pair of apple halves or a scribbled sheet of paper next to a clean one, they pick out the object that wreaked the change, a knife in the first case and an eraser in the second. So not only do chimpanzees maneuver in the physical world, but they have freestanding thoughts about it. Perhaps the circuitry behind those thoughts was co-opted in our lineage for more abstract kinds of causation. How do we know that the minds of living human beings really appreciate the parallels between, say, social and physical pressure, or between space and time? How do we know that people arent just using dead metaphors uncomprehendingly as when we talk of breakfast without thinking of it as breaking a fast? For one thing, space and force metaphors have been reinvented time and again, in dozens of language families across the globe. Even more suggestive evidence comes from my own main field of research, child language acquisition. The psychologist Melissa Bowerman discovered that preschool children spontaneously coin their own metaphors in which space and motion symbolize possession, circumstance, time, and causation: You put me just bread and butter. Mother takes ball away from boy and puts it to girl. Im taking these cracks bigger [while shelling a peanut]. I putted part', 'these elementary concepts may '),
(479, 106, 8, 'This sense of consciousness of course, also embraces Freuds distinction between the conscious and the unconscious mind. As with selfknowledge, there is nothing miraculous or even mysterious about it. Indeed, there are obvious analogues in machines. My computer has access to information about whether the printer is working or not working (it is "conscious" of it, in this particular sense) and can print out an error message, Printer not responding. But it has no access to information about why the printer is not working; the signal carried back along the cable from printer to computer does not include the information. The chip inside the printer, in contrast, does have access to that information (it is conscious of it, in this sense); the sensors in different parts of the printer feed into the chip, and the chip can turn on a yellow light if the toner supply is low and a red light if the paper is jammed. Finally, we come to the most interesting sense of all, sentience: subjective experience, phenomenal awareness, raw feels, first-person present tense, "what it is like" to be or do something, if you have to ask youll never know. Woody Allens joke turned on the difference between this sense of consciousness and Freuds sense of it as access to information 136 J by the deliberative, language-using parts of the mind. And this sense, sentience, is the one in which consciousness seems like a miracle. The remainder of the chapter is about consciousness in these last two senses. First I will look at access, at what kinds of information the different parts of the mind make available to one another. In this sense of the word, we really are coming to understand consciousness. Interesting things can be said about how it is implemented in the brain, the role it plays in mental computation, the engineering specs it is designed to meet (and hence the evolutionary pressures that gave rise to it), and how those specs explain the main features of consciousness sensory awareness, focal attention, emotional coloring, and the will. Finally, I will turn to the problem of sentience. Someday, probably sooner rather than later, we will have a fine understanding of what in the brain is responsible for consciousness in the sense of access to information. Francis Crick and Christof Koch, for example, have set out straightforward criteria for what we should look for. Most obviously, information from sensation and memory guides behavior only in an awake animal, not an anesthetized one. Therefore some of the neural bases of access-consciousness can be found in whatever brain structures act differently when an animal is awake and when it is in a dreamless sleep or out cold. The lower layers of the cerebral cortex are one candidate for that role. Also, we know that information about an object being perceived is scattered across many parts of the cerebral cortex. Therefore information access requires a mechanism that binds together geographically separated data. Crick and Koch suggest that synchronization of neural firing might be one such mechanism, perhaps entrained by loops from the cortex to the thalamus, the cerebrums central way-station. They also note that voluntary, planned behavior pequires activity in the frontal lobes. Therefore access-consciousness may be determined by the anatomy of the fiber tracts running from various parts of the brain to the frontal lobes. Whether or not they are right, they have shown that the problem can be addressed in the lab. Access-consciousness is also a mere problem, not a mystery, in our grasp of the computations carried out by the brain. Recall our uncledetecting', 'This sense of consciousness '),
(480, 107, 8, 'time and culture but our own According to Bettelheim, postwar parents had such an easy time providing their children with creature comforts that they took no pleasure in it, and the children did not develop a feeling of worth from having their basic needs satisfied. Bettelheim claimed to have cured Joey, at first by letting him use a wastebasket instead of the toilet. (He allowed that the therapy "entailed some hardship for his counselors.") Today we know that autism occurs in every country and social class, lasts a lifetime (though sometimes with improvement), and cannot be blamed on mothers. It almost certainly has neurological and genetic causes, though they have not been pinpointed. Baron-Cohen, Frith, and Leslie suggest that autistic children are mind-blind: their module for attributing minds to others is damaged. Autistic children almost never pretend, cant explain the difference between an apple and a memory of an apple, dont distinguish between someones looking into a box and someones touching it, know where a cartoon face is looking but do not guess that it wants what it is looking at, and fail the Smarties (falsebelief) task. Remarkably, they pass a test that is logically the same as the false-belief task but not about minds. The experimenter lifts Rubber Ducky out of the bathtub and puts it on the bed, takes a Polaroid snapshot, and then puts it back in the bathtub. Normal three-year-olds believe that the photo will somehow show the duck in the tub. Autistic children know it does not. Mind-blindness is not caused by real blindness, nor by mental retardation such as Downs syndrome. It is a vivid reminder that the contents of the world are not just there for the knowing but have to be grasped with suitable mental machinery. In a sense, autistic children are right: the universe is nothing but matter in motion. My "normal" mental equipment leaves me chronically dumbfounded at the fact that a microdot and a spoonful of semen can bring about a site of thinking and feeling and that a blood clot or a metal slug can end it. It gives me the delusion that London and chairs and vegetables are on the inventory of the worlds objects. Even the objects themselves are a kind of delusion. Buckminster Fuller once wrote: "Everything youve learnedas obvious becomes less and less obvious as you begin to study the universe. For example, there are no solids in the universe. Theres not even a suggestion of a solid. There are no absolute continuums. There are no surfaces. There are no straight lines." Good Ideas 333 In another sense, of course, the world does have surfaces and chairs and rabbits and minds. They are knots and patterns and vortices of matter and energy that obey their own laws and ripple through the sector of space-time in which we spend our days. They are not social constructions, nor the bits of undigested beef that Scrooge blamed for his vision of Marleys ghost. But to a mind unequipped to find them, they might as well not exist at all. As the psychologist George Miller has put it, "The crowning intellectual accomplishment of the brain is the real world.[A] 11 [the] fundamental aspects of the real world of our experience are adaptive interpretations of the really real world of physics."

Stepparents are surely no more cruel than anyone else. Parenthood is unique among human relationships in its one-sidedness. Parents give; children take. For obvious evolutionary reasons, people are wired to want to make these sacrifices for their own children but not for anyone else. Worse, as we shall see, children are wired to demand these sacrifices of the adults charged with their care, and that can make them downright annoying to people other than their parents and close kin. The writer Nancy Mitford said, "I love children, especially when they cry, for then someone takes them away." But if you are married to the childrens parent, no one ever takes them away. The indifference, even antagonism, of stepparents to stepchildren is simply the standard reaction of a human to another human. It is the endless patience and generosity of a biological parent that is special. This point should not diminish our appreciation of the many benevolent stepparents; if anything, it should enhance it, for they are especially kind and self-sacrificing people. It is often said that you are more likely to be killed by a relative in the home than by a mugger in the street. That sounds suspicious to .anyone who knows about evolutionary theory, and it turns out to be false. Homicide statistics are an important kind of evidence for theories of human relationships. As Daly and Wilson explain, "Killing ones antagoFamily Values 435 nist is the ultimate conflict resolution technique, and our ancestors discovered it long before they were people." Homicides cannot be written off as the product of a diseased mind or a sick society. In most cases a killing is unplanned and undesired; it is the disastrous climax of an escalating battle in which brinkmanship has been carried too far. For every killing there must be countless arguments that cool down and countless threats that are not carried out. That makes homicide an excellent assay for conflict and its causes. Unlike lesser conflicts which can only be discovered through reports that the participants can fudge, a homicide leaves a missing person or a dead body, which are hard to ignore, and homicides are meticulously investigated and documented. People sometimes do murder their relatives. There are infanticides, filicides, parricides, matricides, fratricides, siblicides, uxoricides, familicides, and several unnamed kinds of kin-killing. In a typical data set from an American city, a quarter of the homicides are committed by strangers, a half by acquaintances, and a quarter by "relatives." But most of the relatives are not blood kin. They are spouses, in-laws, and step relations. Only two to six percent of homicide victims are done in by their blood relatives. In fact, that is surely an overestimate. People see their blood relatives more often than they see other people, so relatives are more often within striking distance. When one focuses on people who live together, so that the opportunities for interacting are held constant, one finds that the risk of being killed by a nonrelative is at least eleven times greater than the risk of being killed by a blood relative, and probably much higher than that. The de-escalation of conflicts among blood relatives is part of a larger pattern of kin solidarity called nepotism. In everyday usage the word refers to bestowing favors on relatives (literally, "nephews") as a perquisite of a job or social rank. Institutional nepotism is officially illicit in our society,', 'to a hundred times '),

Tribal shamans are flimflam artists who" supplement their considerable practical knowledge with stage magic, drug-induced trances, and other cheap tricks. Like the Wizard of Oz, they have to keep their beseechers from looking at the man behind the curtain, and that conflicts with the disinterested search for the truth. In a complex society, a dependence on experts leaves us even more vulnerable to quacks, from carnival snake-oil salesman to the mandarins who advise governments to adopt programs implemented by mandarins. Modern scientific practices like peer review, competitive funding, and open mutual criticism are meant to minimize scientists conflicts of interest in principle, and sometimes do so in practice. The stultification of good science by nervous authorities in closed societies is a familiar theme in history, from Catholic southern Europe after Galileo to the Soviet Union in the twentieth century. It is not only science that can suffer under the thumb of those in power. The anthropologist Donald Brown was puzzled to learn that over the millennia the Hindus of India produced virtually no histories, while the neighboring Chinese had produced libraries full. He suspected that the potentates of a hereditary caste society realized that no good could come from a scholar nosing around in records of the past where he might 306 stumble upon evidence undermining their claims to have descended from heroes and gods. Brown looked at twenty-five civilizations and compared the ones organized by hereditary castes with the others. None of the caste societies had developed a tradition of writing accurate depictions of the past; instead of history they had myth and legend. The caste societies were also distinguished by an absence of political science, social science, natural science, biography, realistic portraiture, and uniform education. Good science is pedantic, expensive, and subversive. It was an unlikely selection pressure within illiterate foraging bands like our ancestors, and we should expect peoples native "scientific" abilities to differ from the genuine article. LITTLE BOXES The humorist Robert Benchley said that there are two classes of people in the world: those who divide the people of the world into two classes, and those who do not. In Chapter 2, when I asked why the mind keeps track of individuals, I took it for granted that the mind forms categories. But the habit of categorizing deserves scrutiny as well. People put things and other people into mental boxes, give each box a name, and thereafter treat the contents of a box the same. But if our fellow humans are as unique as their fingerprints and no two snowflakes are alike, why the urge to classify? Psychology textbooks typically give two explanations, neither of which makes sense. One is that memory cannot hold all the events that bombard our senses; by storing only their categories, we cut down on the load. But the brain, with its trillion synapses, hardly seems short of storage space. Its reasonable to say that entities cannot fit in memory when the entities are combinatorial English sentences, chess games, all shapes in all colors and sizes at all locations because the numbers from combinatorial explosions can exceed the number of particles in the universe and overwhelm even the most generous reckoning', 'to different kinds of '),

But as Rozin himself points out, all animals are disgusting except for a few that are permitted. No child has to be taught to revile greasy grimy gopher guts or mutilated monkey meat. Cashdan has a better idea. The first two years, she proposes, are a sensitive period for learning about food. During those years mothers control childrens food intake and children eat whatever they are permitted. Then their tastes spontaneously shrink, and they stomach only the foods they were given during the sensitive period. Those distastes can last to adulthood, though adults occasionally overcome them from a variety of motives: to dine with others, to appear macho or sophisticated, to seek thrills, or to avert starvation when familiar fare is scarce. 382 What is disgust for? Rozin points out that the human species faces "the omnivores dilemma." Unlike, say, koalas, who mainly eat eucalyptus leaves and are vulnerable when those become scarce, omnivores choose from a vast menu of potential foods. The downside is that many are poison. Many fish, amphibians, and invertebrates contain potent neurotoxins. Meats that are ordinarily harmless can house parasites like tapeworms, and when they spoil, meats can be downright deadly, because the microorganisms that cause putrefaction release toxins to deter scavengers and thereby keep the meat for themselves. Even in industrialized countries food contamination is a major danger. Until recently:anthrax and trichinosis were serious hazards, and today public health experts recommend draconian sanitary measures so people wont contract salmonella poisoning from their next chicken salad sandwich. In 1996 a world crisis was set off by the discovery that Mad Cow Disease, a pathology found in some British cattle that makes their brains spongy, might do the same to people who eat the cattle. Rozin ventured that disgust is an adaptation that deterred our ancestors from eating dangerous animal stuff. Feces, carrion, and soft, wet animal parts are home to harmful microorganisms and ought to be kept outside the body. The dynamics of learning about food in childhood fit right in. Which animal parts are safe depends on the local species and their endemic diseases, so particular tastes cannot be innate. Children use their older relatives the way kings used food tasters: if they ate something and lived, it is not poison. Thus very young children are receptive to whatever their parents let them eat, and when they are old enough to forage on their own, they avoid everything else. But how can one explain the irrational effects of similarity the revulsion for rubber vomit, chocolate dog turds, and sterilized roaches? The answer is that these items were crafted to evoke the same reaction in people that the objects themselves evoke. That is why novelty shops sell rubber vomit. The similarity effect merely shows that reassurance by an authority or by ones own beliefs do not disconnect an emotional response. It is no more irrational than other reactions to modern simulacra, such as being engrossed by a movie, aroused by pornography, or terrified on a roller coaster. What about our feeling that disgusting things contaminate everyHotheads 383 thing they touch? It is a straightforward adaptation to a basic fact about the living world: germs multiply. Microorganisms are fundamentally different from chemical poisons such as those manufactured by plants. The danger of a chemical depends on its dose. Poisonous plants are bitter- tasting because both the plant and the plant-eater have an interest in the plant-eater stopping after the first bite.

Revenge of the Nerds 201 According to the standard timetable in paleoanthropology, the human brain evolved to its modern form in a window that began with the appearance of Homo habilis two million years ago and ended with the appearance of "anatomically modern humans," Homo sapiens sapiens, between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. I suspect that our ancestors were penetrating the cognitive niche for far longer than that. Both ends of the R&D process might have to be stretched beyond the textbook dates, providing even more time for our fantastic mental adaptations to have evolved. At one end of the timetable is the four-million-year-old australopithecines- like afarensis (the species of the charismatic fossil called Lucy). They are often described as chimpanzees with upright posture because their brain size was in the chimpanzee ballpark and they left no clear evidence of tool use. That implies that cognitive evolution did not begin till two million years later, when larger-brained habilines earned their "handyman" name by chipping choppers. But that cant be right. First, it is ecologically improbable that a treedweller could have moved onto open ground and retooled its anatomy for upright walking without repercussions on every other aspect of its lifestyle and behavior. Modern chimps use tools and transport objects, and would have had much more incentive and success if they could carry them around freely. Second, though australopithecines hands retain some apelike curvature of the fingers (and may have been used at times to run up trees for safety), the hands visibly evolved for manipulation. Compared to chimps hands, their thumbs are longer and more opposable to the other fingers, and their index and middle fingers are angled to allow cupping the palm to grasp a hammerstone or a ball. Third, its not so clear that they had a chimp-sized brain, or that they lacked tools. The paleoanthropologist Yves Coppens argues that their brains are thirty to forty percent bigger than expected for a chimpanzee of their body size, and that they left behind modified quartz flakes and other tools. Fourth, skeletons of the tool-using habilines (handymen) have now been found, and they do not look so different from the australopithecines. Most important, hominids did not arrange their lives around the convenience of anthropologists. We are lucky that a rock can be carved into a cutter and that it lasts for millions of years, so some of our ancestors inadvertently left us time capsules. But its much harder to carve a rock 202 I into a basket, a baby sling, a boomerang, or a bow and arrow. Contemporary hunter-gatherers use many self-composting implements for every lasting one, and that must have been true of hominids at every stage. The archeological record is bound to underestimate tool use. So the standard timetable for human brain evolution begins the story too late; I think it also ends the story too early. Modern humans (us) are said to have first arisen between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago in Africa. One kind of evidence is that the mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) of everyone on the planet (which is inherited only from ones mother) can be traced back to an African woman living sometime in that period. (The claim is controversial, but the evidence is growing.) Another is that anatomically modern fossils first appear in Africa more than 100,000 years ago and in the Middle East shortly afterward, around 90,000 years ago. The assumption is that human biological evolution had pretty much stopped then. This leaves an anomaly in the timeline. The anatomically modern early humans had the same', 'tools and infest more '),

They explained consequently that the spoor leaving the sleeping place had been made early that morning and was therefore relatively fresh. The spoor then followed a straight course, indicating that the animal was on its way to a specific destination. After a while, one tracker started to investigate several sets of footprints in a particular area. He pointed out that these footprints all belonged to the same animal, but were made during the previous days. He explained that the particular area was the feeding ground of that particular wildebeest. Since it was, by that time, about mid-day, it could be expected that the wildebeest may be resting in the shade in the near vicinity. All foraging peoples manufacture cutters, pounders, containers, cordage, nets, baskets, levers, and spears and other weapons. They use fire, shelters, and medicinal drugs. Their engineering is often ingenious, exploiting poisons, smokeouts, glue traps, gill nets, baited lines, snares, corrals, weirs, camouflaged pits and clifftops, blowguns, bows and arrows, and kites trailing sticky fishing lines made out of spider silk. The reward is an ability to crack the safes of many other living things: burrowing animals, plants underground storage organs, nuts, seeds, bone marrow, tough-skinned animals and plants, birds, fish, shellfish, turtles, poisonous plants (detoxified by peeling, cooking, soaking, parboiling, fermenting, leaching, and other tricks of the kitchen magician), quick animals (which can be ambushed), and large animals (which cooperating groups can drive, exhaust, surround, and dispatch with weapons).

This grown-up man, with pluck and luck Is hoping to outwit a duck. And outwit it he does. Humans have the unfair advantage of attacking in this lifetime organisms that can beef up their defenses only in subsequent ones. Many species cannot evolve defenses rapidly enough, even over evolutionary time, to defend themselves against humans. That is why species drop like flies whenever humans first enter an ecosystem. And its not just the snail darters and snowy owls recently threatened by dams and loggers. The reason you have never se^n a living mastodon, saber-tooth, giant woolly rhinoceros, or other fantastic Ice Age animal is that humans apparently extinguished them thousands of years ago. The cognitive niche embraces many of the zoologically unusual features of our species. Tool manufacture and use is the application of knowledge about causes and effects among objects in the effort to bring about goals. Language is a means of exchanging knowledge. It multiplies the benefit of knowledge, which can not only be used but exchanged for other resources, and lowers its cost, because knowledge can be acquired from the hard-won wisdom, strokes of genius, and trial and error of others rather than only from risky exploration and experimentation. Information can be shared at a negligible cost: if I give you a fish, I no longer possess the fish, but if I give you information on how to fish, I still possess the information myself. So an information-exploiting lifestyle goes well with living in groups and pooling expertise that is, with culture. Cultures differ from one another because they pool bodies of expertise fashioned in different times and places. A prolonged childhood is an apprenticeship for knowledge and skills.

Having misgivings about your mother-inlaw is pentheraphobia, and being petrified of peanut butter sticking to the roof of your mouth is arachibutyrophobia. And then theres Franklin Delano Roosevelts affliction, the fear of fear itself, or phobophobia. But just as not having a word for an emotion doesnt mean that it doesnt exist, having a word for an emotion doesnt mean that it does exist.

Their idea of a good time is to find the shortest word that contains all the vowels in alphabetical order or to write a novel without the letter e. Yet another joy of lex is finding names for hypothetical fears. That is where these improbable phobias come from. Real people do not tremble at the referent of every euphonious Greek or Latin root. Fears and phobias fall into a short and universal list. Snakes and spiders are always scary. They are the most common objects of fear and loathing in studies of college students phobias, and have been so for a long time in our evolutionary history. D. O. Hebb found that chimpanzees born in captivity scream in terror when they first see a snake, and the primatologist Marc Hauser found that his laboratorybred cotton-top tamarins (a South American monkey) screamed out alarm calls when they saw a piece of plastic tubing on the floor. The reaction of foraging peoples is succinctly put by Irven DeVore: "Hunter-gatherers will not suffer a snake to live." In cultures that revere snakes, people still treat them with great wariness. Even Indiana Jones was afraid of them! The other common fears are of heights, storms, large carnivores, darkness, blood, strangers, confinement, deep water, social scrutiny, and leaving home alone. The common thread is obvious. These are the situations that put our evolutionary ancestors in danger. Spiders and snakes are often venomous, especially in Africa, and most of the others are obvious hazards to a foragers health, or, in the case of social scrutiny, status. Fear is the emotion that motivated our ancestors to cope with the dangers they were likely to face. Fear is probably several emotions. Phobias of physical things, of social Hotheads 387 scrutiny, and of leaving home respond to different kinds of drugs, suggesting that they are computed by different brain circuits. The psychiatrist Isaac Marks has shown that people react in different ways to different frightening things, each reaction appropriate to the hazard. An animal triggers an urge to flee, but a precipice causes one to freeze. Social threats lead to shyness and gestures of appeasement. People really do faint at the sight of blood, because their blood pressure drops, presumably a response that would minimize the further loss of ones own blood. The best evidence that fears are adaptations and not just bugs in the nervous system is that animals that have evolved on islands without predators lose their fear and are sitting ducks for any invader hence the expression "dead as a dodo." Fears in modern city-dwellers protect us from dangers that no longer exist, and fail to protect us from dangers in the world around us. We ought to be afraid of guns, driving fast, driving without a seatbelt, lighter fluid, and hair dryers near bathtubs, not of snakes and spiders.

Is consciousness an impotent side effect hovering over the symbols, like the lights flashing on a computer or the thunder that accompanies lightning? And if consciousness is useless if a creature without it could negotiate the world as well as a creature with it why would natural selection have favored the conscious one? Consciousness has recently become the circle that everyone wants to square. Almost every month an article announces that consciousness has been explained at last, often with a raspberry blown at the theologians and humanists who would put boundaries on science and another one Thinking Machines 133 for the scientists and philosophers who dismiss the topic as too subjective or muddled to be studyable. Unfortunately, many of the things that people write about consciousness are almost as puzzling as consciousness itself. Stephen Jay Gould wrote, "Homo sapiens is one small twig [on the tree of life].Yet our twig, for better or worse, has developed the most extraordinary new quality in all the history of multicellular life since the Cambrian explosion. We have invented consciousness with all its sequelae from Hamlet to Hiroshima." Gould has denied consciousness to all nonhuman animals; other scientists grant it to some animals but not all. Many test for consciousness by seeing whether an animal recognizes that the image in a mirror is itself and not another animal. By this standard, monkeys, young chimpanzees, old chimpanzees, elephants, and human toddlers are unconscious. The only conscious animals are gorillas, orangutans, chimpanzees in their prime, and, according to Skinner and his student Robert Epstein, properly trained pigeons. Others are even more restrictive than Gould: not even all people are conscious. Julian Jaynes claimed that consciousness is a recent invention. The people of early civilizations, including the Greeks of Homer and the Hebrews of the Old Testament, were unconscious. Dennett is sympathetic to the claim; he believes that consciousness "is largely a product of cultural evolution that gets imparted to brains in early training" and that it is "a huge complex of memes," meme being Dawkins term for a contagious feature of culture, such as a catchy jingle or the latest fashion craze. Something about the topic of consciousness makes people, like the White Queen in Through the Looking Glass, believe six impossible things before breakfast. Could most animals really be unconscious sleepwalkers, zombies, automata, out cold? Hath not a dog senses, affections, passions? If you prick them, do they not feel pain? And was Moses really unable to taste salt or see red or enjoy sex? Do children learn to become conscious in the same way that they learn to wear baseball caps turned around? People who write about consciousness are not crazy, so they must have something different in mind when they use the word. One of the best observations about the concept of consciousness came from Woody Allen in his hypothetical college course catalogue: Introduction to Psychology: The theory of human behavior.Is there a split between mind and body, and, if so, which is better to have? 134Special consideration is given to a study of consciousness as opposed to unconsciousness, with many helpful hints on how to remain conscious. Verbal humor sets readers up with one meaning of an ambiguous word and surprises them with another. Theoreticians also trade on the ambiguity of the word consciousness, not as a joke but as a bait-and-switch: the reader is led to expect a theory for one sense of the word, the hardest to explain, and is given a theory for another sense, the easiest to, explain.

When it comes to bachelors, many people such as immigration authorities, justices of the peace, and health care bureaucrats are notoriously Mwfuzzy about who belongs in the category; as we all know, a lot can hinge on a piece of paper. Examples of unfuzzy thinking are everywhere. A judge may free an obviously guilty suspect on a technicality. Bartenders deny beer to a responsible adult the day before his twenty-first birthday. We joke that you cant be a little bit pregnant or a little bit married, and after a Canadian survey reported that married women have sex 1.57 times a week, the cartoonist Terry Mosher drew a woman sitting up in bed beside her dozing husband and muttering, "Well, that was .57." In fact, fuzzy and crisp versions of the same category can live side by side in a single head. The psychologists Sharon Armstrong, Henry Gleitman, and Lila Gleitman mischievously gave the standard tests for fuzzy categories to university students but asked them about knife-edged categories like "odd number" and "female." The subjects happily agreed to daft statements such as that 13 is a better example of an odd number than 23 is, and that a mother is a better example of a female than a comedienne is. Moments later the subjects also claimed that a number either is odd or is even, and that a person either is female or is male, with no gray areas. People think in two modes. They can form fuzzy stereotypes by uninsightfully soaking up correlations among properties, taking advantage of the fact that things in the world tend to fall into clusters (things that bark also bite and lift their legs at hydrants). But people can also create systems of rules intuitive theories that define categories in terms of the rules that apply to them, and that treat all the members of the category equally. All cultures have systems of formal kinship rules, often so precise that one can prove theorems in them. Our own kinship system gives us a crisp version of "grandmother": the mother of a parent, muffins be damned. Law, arithmetic, folk science, and social conventions (with their rites of passage sharply delineating adults from children and husbands from bachelors) are other rule systems in which people all over the planet reckon. The grammar of a language is yet another. Rule systems allow us to rise above mere similarity and reach conclusions based on explanations. Hinton, Rumelhart, and McClelland wrote: "People are good at generalizing newly acquired knowledge. If, for example, you learn that chimpanzees like onions you will probably raise your estimate of the probability that gorillas like onions. In a network that uses distributed representations, this kind of generalization is auto128 matic." Their boast is a twentieth-century echo of Humes remark that from a body similar to bread in color and consistency we expect a similar degree of nourishment. But the assumption breaks down in any domain in which a person actually knows something. The onion-loving gorilla was intended only as an example, of course, but it is interesting to see how even this simple example underestimates us. Knowing a bit of zoology and not much about gorillas, I would definitely not raise my estimate of the probability that gorillas like onions. Animals can be cross-classified.

Others thought they were hidebound traditions whose inefficiency had gone unnoticed, as with the genius who figured out that toll bridges could charge a dollar to the traffic going one way instead of fifty cents to the traffic going both ways. These sentiments came not just from rock musicians but from Americas distinguished social critics. In his 1970 book The Greening of America, the Yale law professor Charles Reich heralded a nonviolent revolution being led by the college-age generation. The youth of America had evolved a new consciousness, he said. It was less guilty and anxious, nonjudgmental, noncompetitive, nonmaterialistic, affectionate, honest, unmanipulative, unaggressive, communal, and unconcerned with status 425 426 I and careers. The new consciousness, emerging like flowers through the pavement, was expressed in their music, communes, hitchhiking, drugs, moon-gazing, peace salute, and even their clothing. Bell-bottoms, he said, "give the ankles a special freedom as if to invite dancing right on the street." The new consciousness promised "a higher reason, a more human community, and a new and liberated individual. Its ultimate creation will be a new and enduring wholeness and beauty a renewed relationship of man to himself, to other men, to society, to nature, and to the land." Greening sold a million copies in a few months. It was serialized in the New Yorker and discussed in a dozen articles in the New York Times and in a volume of essays by the leading intellectuals of the day. John Kenneth Galbraith gave it a positive review (though with a caveat expressed in his title: "Whos Minding the Store?"). The book recently came out in a twenty-fifth anniversary edition. Reich wrote his book in the Yale dining halls, and based it on his conversations with the students there. Those students, of course, were among the most privileged individuals in the history of humanity. With Mom and Dad paying the bills, everyone around them coming from the upper classes, and Ivy League credentials about to launch them into the expanding economy of the 1960s, it was easy to believe that all you need is love. After graduation day, Reichs generation became the Gucciwearing, Beemer-driving, condo-owning, gourmet-baby-breeding urban professionals of the 1980s and 90s. Universal harmony was a style as ephemeral as the bell-bottoms, a status symbol that distanced them from rednecks, jocks, and the less hip preppies. As the post-60s rock musician Elvis Costello asked, "Was it a millionaire who said Imagine no possessions?" The Woodstock Nation was not the first Utopian dream to be shattered. The free-love communes of nineteenth-century America collapsed from sexual jealousy and the resentment of both sexes over the leaders habit of accumulating young mistresses. The socialist Utopias of the twentieth century became repressive empires led by men who collected Cadillacs and concubines. In anthropology, one South Sea island paradise after another has turned out to be nasty and brutish. Margaret Mead said that nonchalant sex made the Samoans satisfied and free of crime; it turned out that the boys tutored one another in rape techniques. She called the Arapesh "gentle"; they were headhunters. She said that the Tshambuli reversed our sex roles, the men wearing curls and Family Values 427 makeup. In fact the men beat their wives, exterminated neighboring tribes, and treated homicide as a milestone in a young mans life which entitled him to wear the face paint that Mead thought was so effeminate.

(490, 117, 8, 'use the words and the concepts to measure to count more accurately, and to count, add, and subtract larger numbers. All cultures have words for numbers, though sometimes only "one," "two," and "many." Before you snicker, remember that the concept of number has nothing to do with the size of a number vocabulary. Whether or not people know words for big numbers (like "four" or "quintillion"), they can know that if two sets are the same, and you add 1 to one of them, that set is now larger. That is true whether the sets have four items or a quintillion items. People know that they can compare the size of two sets by pairing off their members and checking for leftovers; even mathematicians are forced to that technique when they make strange claims about the relative sizes of infinite sets. Cultures without words for big numbers often use tricks like holding up fingers, pointing to parts of the body in sequence, or grabbing or lining up objects in twos and threes. Children as young as two enjoy counting, lining up sets, and other activities guided by a sense of number. Preschoolers count small sets, even when they have to mix kinds of objects, or have to mix objects, actions, and sounds. Before they really get the hang of counting and measuring, they appreciate much of its logic. For example, they will try to distribute a hot dog equitably by cutting it up and giving everyone two pieces (though the pieces may be of different sizes), and they yell at a counting puppet who misses an item or counts it twice, though their own counting is riddled with the same kinds of errors. Formal mathematics is an extension of our mathematical intuitions. Arithmetic obviously grew out of our sense of number, and geometry out of our sense of shape and space. The eminent mathematician Saunders Mac Lane speculated that basic human activities were the inspiration for every branch of mathematics: Counting -» arithmetic and number theory Measuring > real numbers, calculus, analysis Shaping > geometry, topology Forming (as in architecture) > symmetry, group theory Estimating > probability, measure theory, statistics Moving > mechanics, calculus, dynamics Calculating > algebra, numerical analysis Proving > logic 340 I Puzzling » combinatorics, number theory Grouping > set theory, combinatorics Mac Lane suggests that "mathematics starts from a variety of human activities, disentangles from them a number of notions which are generic and not arbitrary, then formalizes these notions and their manifold interrelations." The power of mathematics is that the formal rule systems can then "codify deeper and nonobvious properties of the various originating human activities." Everyone even a blind toddler instinctively knows that the path from A straight ahead to B and then right to C is longer than the shortcut from A to C. Everyone also visualizes how a line can define the edge of a square and how shapes can be abutted to form bigger shapes. But it takes a mathematician to show that the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides, so one can calculate the savings of the shortcut without traversing it. To say that school mathematics comes out of intuitive mathematics is not to say that it comes out easily. David Geary has suggested that natural selection gave children some basic mathematical abilities: determining the quantity of small sets, understanding relations like "more than" and "less than" and the ordering of small numbers, adding and subtracting small sets, and using number words for simple counting, measurement, and arithmetic.

(491, 118, 8, 'voluntarily and the genuine expressions are hard to fake, though we can pantomime an approximation. Actors must simulate facial expressions for a living, but many cannot avoid a mannered look. Some great actors, like Laurence Olivier, are highly coordinated athletes who have doggedly learned to control every muscle. Others learn method acting, inspired by Konstantin Stanislavsky, in which actors make themselves feel an emotion by remembering or imagining a charged experience, and the expression pops on the face reflexively. The explanation is incomplete, because it raises another question: why did we never evolve the ability to control our expressions? You cant just say that it would hurt everyone if counterfeit expressions were circulated. True enough, but in a world of honest emoters the faker would prosper, so fakers should always drive out emoters. I dont know the answer, but there are obvious places to look. Zoologists worry about the same problem: how can honest animal signals, like cries, gestures, and advertisements of health, evolve in a world of would-be fakers? One answer is that honest signals can evolve if they are too expensive to fake. For example, only a healthy peacock can afford a splendiferous tail, so healthy peacocks bear the burden of a cumbersome tail as a display of conspicuous consumption that only they can afford. When the healthiest peacocks display, the less healthy ones have no choice but to follow, because if they hide their health altogether the peahens will assume the worst, namely that they are at deaths door. Is there anything about emotional expressions that would make it inherently costly to put them under voluntary control? Here is a guess. In designing the rest of the human, natural selection had good engineering reasons to segregate the voluntary, cognitive systems from the systems that control housekeeping and physical-plant functions such as the 416 J regulation of heartbeat, breathing rate, blood circulation, sweat, tears, and saliva. None of your conscious beliefs are pertinent to how fast your heart ought to beat, so theres no point in letting you control it. In fact, it would be downright dangerous, since you might forget to pump when you got distracted, or you might try out your own harebrained ideas on what the best pulse rate should be. Now, say selection handcuffed each emotion to a physiological control circuit, and the activity of the circuit was visible to an observer as flushing, blushing, blanching, sweating, trembling, quavering, croaking, weeping, and the facial reflexes Darwin discussed. An observer would have good reason to believe that the emotion was genuine, since a person could not fake it unless he had voluntary control of his heart and other organs. Just as the Soviets would have wanted to show everyone the wiring of the Doomsday Machine to frove that it was automatic and irreversible and their description of it no bluff, people might have an interest in showing everyone that an emotion is holding their body hostage and their angry words are no bluff. If so, it would explain why emotions are so intimately tied to the body, a fact that puzzled William James and a century of psychologists after him. The handcuffing may have been easy for natural selection, because the major human emotions seem to have grown out of evolutionary precursors (anger from fighting, fear from fleeing, and so on), each of which engaged a suite of involuntary physiological responses. (This might be the grain of truth in the Romantic and triune-brain theories: modern emotions may exploit the involuntariness of older reflexes, even if they did not inherit it by default.)

(As always, that would be how our tastes were engineered; the reasoning does not imply that a man literally wants lots and lots of babies.) She should be fertile, which means she should be healthy and past the age of puberty but before the age of menopause. But a womans current fertility is more relevant to a one-night stand than to a lifelong marriage. What counts is the number of offspring he can expect over the long term. Since a woman can bear and nurse one child every few years, and her childbearing years are finite, the younger the bride, the bigger the future family. That is true even though the youngest brides, teenagers, are somewhat less fertile than women in their early twenties. Ironically for the men-are-slime theory, an eye for nubile women may have evolved in the service of marriage and fatherhood, not one-night stands. Among chimpanzees, where a fathers role ends with copulation, some of the wrinkled and saggy females are the sexiest. Are the predictions just old-fashioned stereotypes? Buss designed a questionnaire asking about the importance of eighteen qualities of a mate and gave it to ten thousand people in thirty-seven countries on six continents and five islands monogamous and polygynous, traditional and liberal, communist and capitalist. Men and women everywhere place the highest value of all on intelligence and on kindness and understanding. But in every country men and women differ on the other qualities. Women value earning capacity more than men do; the size of the difference varies from a third more to one and a half times more, but its always there. In virtually every country, women place a greater value than 482 men on status, ambition, and industriousness. And in most, they value dependability and stability more than men do. In every country, men place a higher value on youth and on looks than women do. On average, men want a bride 2.66 years younger; women want a groom 3.42 years older. The results have been replicated many times. Peoples actions tell the same story. According to the contents of personal advertisements, Men Seeking Women seek youth and looks, Women Seeking Men seek financial security, height, and sincerity. The owner of one dating service observed, "Women really read over our profile forms; guys just look at the pictures." Among married couples, the husband is 2.99 years older than the wife, as if they had split the difference between their preferences. In foraging cultures, everyone agrees that some people are sexier than others, and the sexpots are usually young women and prestigious men.

When shown slides, Western observers of both sexes agree with the Yanomamo men that the moho dudei women are the most attractive. In our society, the best predictor of a mans wealth is his wifes looks, and the best predictor of a womans looks is her husbands wealth.

These days its impolite to talk about parental love having anything to do with biological relatedness because it sounds like a slur on the many parents with adopted children and stepchildren. Of course couples love their adopted children; if they werent unusually committed to simulating a natural family experience they would not have adopted to start with. But stepfamilies are different. The stepparent has shopped for a spouse, not a child; the child is a cost that comes as part of the deal. Stepparents have a poor reputation; even Websters unabridged dictionary defines stepmother, in one of its two definitions, as "one that fails to give proper care or attention." The psychologists Martin Daly and Margo Wilson comment: The negative characterization of stepparents is by no means peculiar to our culture. The folklorist who consults Stith Thompsons massive Motif- Index of Folk Literature will encounter such pithy synopses as "Evil stepmother orders stepdaughter to be killed" (Irish myth), and "Evil stepmother works stepdaughter to death in absence of merchant husband" (India). For convenience, Thompson divided stepfather tales into two categories: "cruel stepfathers" and "lustful stepfathers." From Eskimos to Indonesians, through dozens of tales, the stepparent is a villain in every piece. Daly and Wilson note that many social scientists assume that the difficulties plaguing step relationships are caused by "the myth of the cruel stepparent." But why, they ask, should stepparents in so many cultures be targets of the same slander? Their own explanation is more direct. The ubiquity of Cinderella storiesis surely a reflection of certain basic, recurring tensions in human society. Women must often have been forsaken with dependent children throughout human history, and both fathers and mothers were often prematurely widowed. If the survivor wished to forge a new marital career, then the fate of the children became problematic. [Among the Tikopia and the Yanomamo, the husband] demands the death of his new wifes prior children. Other solutions have included leaving the children with postmenopausal matrilineal relatives, and the levirate, a widespread custom by which a widow and her children are inherited by the dead mans brother or other near relative. In the absence of such arrangements, children were obliged to tag along as stepchildren under the care of nonrelatives with no particular 434 J benevolent interest in their welfare. They surely had genuine cause for alarm. In one study of emotionally healthy middle-class families in the United States, only half of the stepfathers and a quarter of the stepmothers claimed to have "parental feeling" toward their stepchildren, and fewer still claimed to "love" them. The enormous pop-psychology literature on reconstituted families is dominated by one theme: coping with antagonisms.

By erasing the contents and filling in the blanks with new symbols, we can adapt our inherited forms to more abstruse domains. Some of these revisions may have taken place in our evolution, giving us basic Good Ideas 359 mental categories like ownership, time, and will out of forms originally designed for intuitive physics. Other revisions take place as we live our lives and grapple with new realms of knowledge. Even the most recondite scientific reasoning is an assembly of downhome mental metaphors. We pry our faculties loose from the domains they were designed to work in, and use their machinery to make sense of new domains that abstractly resemble the old ones. The metaphors we think in are lifted not only from basic scenarios like moving and bumping but from entire ways of knowing. To do academic biology, we take our way of understanding artifacts and apply it to organisms. To do chemistry, we treat the essence of a natural kind as a collection of tiny, bouncy, sticky objects. To do psychology, we treat the mind as a natural kind. Mathematical reasoning both takes from and gives to the other parts of the mind. Thanks to graphs, we primates grasp mathematics with our eyes and our minds eye. Functions are shapes (linear, flat, steep, crossing, smooth), and operating is doodling in mental imagery (rotating, extrapolating, filling, tracing). In return, mathematical thinking offers new ways to understand the world. Galileo wrote that "the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics; without its help it is impossible to comprehend a single word of it." Galileos dictum applies not only to equation-filled blackboards in the physics department but to elementary truths we take for granted. The psychologists Carol Smith and Susan Carey have found that children have odd beliefs about matter. Children know that a heap of rice weighs something but claim that a grain of rice weighs nothing. When asked to imagine cutting a piece of steel in half repeatedly, they say that one will finally arrive at a piece so small that it no longer takes up space or has any steel inside it. They are not of unsound mind. Every physical event has a threshold below which no person or device can detect it. Repeated division of an object results in objects too small to detect; a collection of objects each of which falls below the threshold may be detectable en masse. Smith and Carey note that we find childrens beliefs silly because we can construe matter using our concept of number. Only in the realm of mathematics does repeated division of a positive quantity always yield a positive quantity, and repeated addition of zero always yields zero. Our understanding of the physical world is more sophisticated than childrens because we have merged our intuitions about objects with our intuitions about number. So vision was co-opted for mathematical thinking, which helps us see 360 I the world. Educated understanding is an enormous contraption of parts within parts. Each part is built out of basic mental models or ways of knowing that are copied, bleached of their original content, connected to other models, and packaged into larger parts, which can be packaged into still larger parts without limit. Because human thoughts are combinatorial (simple parts combine) and recursive (parts can be embedded within parts), breathtaking expanses of knowledge can be explored with', 'We have inherited a '),

Asset-holders, then, are not just seen as holders of their assets. They exude an aura or charisma that makes people want to be in their graces. Its always handy to have people want to be in your graces, so status itself is worth craving. But there are only so many hours in the day, and sycophants must choose whom to fawn over, so status is a limited resource. If A has more, B must have less, and they must compete. Even in the dog-eat-dog world of tribal leadership, physical dominance is not everything. Chagnon reports that some Yanomamo headmen are flamboyant bullies but others achieve their station by shrewdness and discretion. A man named Kaobawa, though no wimp, earned his authority by leaning on the support of his brothers and cousins and cultivating alliances with the men with whom he had traded wives. He conserved his authority by giving orders only when he was sure everyone would follow them, and magnified it by breaking up fights, disarming machete-wielding maniacs, and bravely scouting the village alone when raiders were in evidence. His quiet leadership was rewarded with six wives and as many affairs. In foraging societies, status also clings to good hunters and knowledgeable naturalists. Assuming that our ancestors, too, practiced occasional meritocracy, human evolution was not always the survival of the fiercest. Romantic anthropologists used to claim that foraging peoples were unmoved by wealth. But that is because the foragers they studied didnt have any. Twentieth-century hunter-gatherers are unrepresentative of humanity in one respect. They live on land that no one else wants, land that cannot be farmed. They dont necessarily prefer their deserts, rainforests, and tundras, but farming peoples like us have taken the rest. Though foragers cannot achieve the massive inequality that comes from cultivating and storing food, they do have inequality, both of wealth and of prestige. The Kwakiutl of the Canadian Pacific coast enjoyed annual runs of salmon and abundant sea mammals and berries. They settled in villages run by wealthy chiefs who tried to outdo one another in competitive feasts called potlatches. The guests at a potlatch were encouraged to gorge themselves on salmon and berries, and the chief boastfully showered them with boxes of oil, baskets of berries, and piles of blankets. The humiliated guests slunk back to their village and plotted revenge with an even bigger feast, in which they would not only give away valuables but ostentatiously destroy them. The chief would start a roaring fire in the center of his house and stoke it with fish oil, blankets, furs, canoe paddles, canoes, and sometimes the house itself, a spectacle of consumption the world would not see again until the American bar mitzvah. Veblen proposed that the psychology of prestige was driven by three "pecuniary canons of taste": conspicuous leisure, conspicuous consumption, and conspicuous waste. Status symbols are flaunted and coveted not necessarily because they are useful or attractive (pebbles, daisies, and pigeons are quite beautiful, as we rediscover when they delight young children), but often because they are so rare, wasteful, or pointless that only the wealthy can afford them. They include clothing that is too delicate, bulky, constricting, or stain-prone to work in, objects too fragile for casual use or made from unobtainable materials, functionless objects made with prodigious labor, decorations that consume energy, and pale skin in lands where the plebeians work in the fields and suntans in lands where they work indoors. The logic is:', 'wealth through gifts or '),
(497, 124, 8, 'whether these four habits formed the base camp for the ascent of human intelligence. And no one knows whether there are other, untried gradients to intelligence in biological design space. But if these traits do explain why our ancestors were the only species out of fifty million to follow that route, it would have sobering implications for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. A planet with life may not be enough of a launching pad. Its history might have to include a nocturnal predator (to get stereo vision), with descendants that switched to a diurnal lifestyle (for color) in which they depended on fruit 198 and were vulnerable to predators (for group living), which then changed their means of locomotion to swinging beneath branches (for hands and for precursors to upright posture), before a climate shift sent them from the forest into grasslands (for upright posture and hunting). \Vhat is the probability that a given planet, even a planet with life, has such a history? Millions of years before our brains billowed out, some descendants of the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans walked upright. In the 1920s that discovery came as a shock to human chauvinists who imagined that our glorious brains led us up the ladder, perhaps as our ancestors decided at each rung what use to make of their newfound smarts. But natural selection could not have worked that way. Why bulk up your brain if you cant put it to use? The history of paleoanthropology is the discovery of earlier and earlier birthdays for upright posture. The most recent discoveries put it at four or even four and a half million years ago. With hands freed, subsequent species ratchet upward, click by click, iri the features that distinguish us: the dexterity of hands, the sophistication of tools, the dependence on hunting, the size of brains, the range of habitats. The teeth and jaw become smaller. The face that opposes it becomes less muzzle-like. The brow ridges that anchor the muscles that close the jaw shrink and disappear. Our delicate faces differ from the brutes because tools and technology have taken over from teeth. We slaughter and skin animals with blades, and soften plants and meats with fire. That eases the mechanical demands on the jaw and skull, allowing us to shave bone from our already heavy heads. The sexes come to differ less in size, suggesting that males spent less of their resources beating each other up and perhaps more on their children and the childrens mothers. The stepwise growth of the brain, propelled by hands and feet and manifested in tools, butchered bones, and increased range, is good evidence, if evidence were needed, that intelligence is a product of natural selection for exploitation of the cognitive niche. The package was not an inexorable unfolding of hominid potential. Other species, omitted from the table, spun off in every epoch to occupy slightly different niches: nutcracking and root-gnawing australopithecines, perhaps one of the two habiline subtypes, quite possibly the Asian branches of erectus and archaic sapiens, and probably the Ice Age-adapted Neanderthals. Each species might have been outcompeted when a neighboring, more sapiens-\\ke population had entered far enough into the cognitive niche to duplicate the species more specialized feats and do much else besides. The package was also not the gift of a macromutation or random drift for how could such luck have held up in one lineage for millions of years, over hundreds of thousands of generations, in species after bigger- brained species? Moreover, the bigger brains were no mere ornaments but allowed their owners to make', 'whether these four habits '),
(498, 125, 8, 'which a concept does not get its own unit ("parrot") but is represented by a pattern of activity over units for its properties ("feathered," "winged," and so on), allows for automatic generalization to similar concepts and thus nicely fits thie law of association by resemblance. And if all parts of the mind start off as the same kind of network, we have an implementation of the blank slate. Connectionism thus offers an opportunity. In seeing what simple neuralnetwork models can and cannot do, we can put the centuries-old doctrine of the association of ideas to a rigorous test. Before we begin, we need to set aside some red herrings. Connectionism is not an alternative to the computational theory of mind, but a variety of it, which claims that the main kind of information processing done by the mind is multivariate statistics. Connectionism is not a necessary corrective to the theory that the mind is like a commercial computer, with a high-speed, error-free, serial central processing unit; no one holds that theory. And there is no real-life Achilles who claims that every form of thinking consists of cranking through thousands of rules from a logic textbook. Finally, connectionist networks are not particularly realistic models of the brain, despite the hopeful label "neural networks." For example, the "synapse" (connection weight) can switch from excitatory to inhibitory, and information can flow in both directions along an "axon" (connection), both anatomically impossible. When there is a choice between getting a job done and mirroring the brain, connectionists often opt for getting the job done; that shows that the networks are used as a form of artificial intelligence based loosely on the metaphor of neurons, and are not a form of neural modeling. The question is, do they perform the right kinds of computations to model the workings of human thought? Raw connectoplasm has trouble with five feats of everyday thinking. The feats appear to be subtle at first, and were not even suspected of existing until logicians, linguists, and computer scientists begaft to put the meanings of sentences under a microscope. But the fdats give human thought its distinctive precision and power and are, I think, an important part of the answer to the question, How does the mind work? One feat is entertaining the concept of an individual. Lets go back to the first departure of neural networks from computerlike representaThinking Machines 115 tions. Rather than symbolizing an entity as an arbitrary pattern in a string of bits, we represented it as a pattern in a layer of units, each standing for one of the entitys properties. An immediate problem is that there is no longer a way to tell apart two individuals with identical properties. They are represented in one and the same way, and the system is blind to the fact that they are not the same hunk of matter. We have lost the individual: we can represent vegetableness or horsehood, but not a particular vegetable or a particular horse. Whatever the system learns about one horse melds into what it knows about another, identical one. And there is no natural way to represent two horses. Making the horsey nodes twice as active wont do it, because that is indistinguishable from being twice as confident that the properties of a horse are present or from thinking that the properties of a horse are present to twice the degree. It is easy to confuse the relationship between a class and a subclass, such as "animal" and "horse" (which a network handles easily), with the relationship between a subclass and an individual, such', 'which a concept does '),

But categories would be useful only if they meshed with the way the world works. Fortunately for us, the worlds objects are not evenly sprinkled throughout the rows and columns of the inventory list defined by the properties we notice. The worlds inventory is lumpy. Creatures with cotton tails tend have long ears and live in woodland clearings; creatures with fins tend to have scales and live in the water. Other than in the childrens books with split pages for assembling do-it-yourself chimeras, there are no finned cottontails or floppy-eared fish. Mental boxes work because things come in clusters that fit the boxes. What makes the birds of a feather cluster together? The world is sculpted and sorted by laws that science and mathematics aim to discover. The laws of physics dictate that objects denser than water are found on the bottom of a lake, not its surface. Laws of natural selection and physics dictate that objects that move swiftly through fluids have streamlined shapes. The laws of genetics make offspring resemble their parents. Laws of anatomy, physics, and human intentions force chairs to have shapes and materials that make them stable supports. 1 eople form two kinds of categories, as we saw in Chapter 2. We treat games and vegetables as categories that have stereotypes, fuzzy boundaries, and family-like resemblances. That kind of category falls naturally out of pattern-associator neural networks. We treat odd numbers and females as categories that have definitions, in-or-out boundaries, and common threads running through the members. That kind of category is naturally computed by systems of rules. We put some things into both kinds of mental categories we think of "a grandmother" as a gray-haired muffin dispenser; we also think of "a grandmother" as the female parent of a parent. Good Ideas 309 Now we can explain what these two ways of thinking are for. Fuzzy categories come from examining objects and uninsightfully recording the correlations among their features. Their predictive power comes from similarity: if A shares some features with B, it probably shares others. They work by recording the clusters in reality. Well-defined categories, in contrast, work by ferreting out the laws that put the clusters there. They fall out of the intuitive theories that capture peoples best guess about what makes the world tick. Their predictive power comes from deduction: if A implies B, and A is true, then B is true. Real science is famous for transcending fuzzy feelings of similarity and getting at underlying laws. Whales are not fish; people are apes; solid matter is mostly empty space. Though ordinary people dont think exactly like scientists, they too let their theories override similarity when they reason about how the world works. Which two out of three belong together: white hair, gray hair, black hair? How about white cloud, gray cloud, black cloud? Most people say that black is the odd hair out, because aging hair turns gray and then white, but that white is the odd cloud out, because gray and black clouds give rain. Say I tell you I have a three-inch disk. Which is it more similar to, a quarter or a pizza? Which is it more likely to be, a quarter or a pizza? Most people say it is more similar to a quarter but more likely to be a pizza. They reason that quarters have to be standardized but pizzas can vary.
