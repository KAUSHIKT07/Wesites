Her face was kind and full of love. "Grandmother!" cried the little girl. "Please, take me with you!" But her grandmother started to fade as the match burned out. "No!" screamed the little girl. "Dont go!" And she rubbed all of her matches against the wall. She wanted to keep her grandmother near her. And the matches gave such a bright light. It was brighter even than at noon. Her grandmother became solid again. She took the little girl on her arm. Both flew up into the light. And there was no cold. There was no hunger. They were both in Heaven. The little girl was so happy. On the street, people stopped at the corner. There they saw the little girl. She was sitting curled up very tightly. It was still very cold. But the girls cheeks were rosy. She had a smile on her face. She had a bundle of matches in her hand. They were burnt out. "She wanted to warm herself," people said. They looked at her body with pity. But no one had any idea of what she had seen. No one even dreamed of her joy. With her grandmother, she was finally happy. With her grandmother, she celebrated the New Year. Managers need a new toolkit to manage at the portfolio level. Some are very new; others may look familiar. But dont be fooled. To create new value with a brand portfolio approach it is necessary to use some of these familiar tools in unfamiliar ways. It is like using a hammer in space - it wont feel or look the same as when you use it on the ground. Extensions are the simplest, oldest, and most common approach to boosting portfolio returns. The key to using extensions strategically is to recognize that there are two different types of extensions that can be applied to each brand portfolio. For less dense portfolios, extension opportunities exist in the open spaces of the molecule. We call these opportunities interstitial extensions because they fill the gaps between the strategic brands in a portfolio. The second type is the boundary extension. They create new brands on the outer edges of an existing brand molecule. Positioning requires consumers to learn what a brand portfolio stands for. Repositioning requires they first unlearn what it no longer stands for. Of all the tools, none comes with a higher risk/reward ratio than repositioning. Three components play a role in a repositioning: a new communications campaign, the launch of new products or services that signal the new direction of the portfolio, and alliances with companies or brand portfolios whose positioning lies close to where you want to take your brand portfolio. Pruning brands in a portfolio should occur periodically, in times of strong and weak performance alike. Managers can also improve the chances of success by using the brand molecule to decide which brands can be cut at minimal risk. Finally, the brands that are cut should be cleanly severed from the portfolio. Over-brands or umbrellas can provide scale opportunities to subscale portfolios. They make sense when they provide an additional trustmark on branded products in categories where existing brands are weak and when they help launch new products or put them in new geographies. Over-branding works when it ties together portfolios with similar customer bases, distribution channels, and price points. Co-brands, leveraged well, can help bring a brand to your', 'a soul goes up '),

It can reduce the risk of boundary brand extensions and put unused brand equity to work. Often the risk is more manageable than with other tools. Amalgamation consists of merging two brand portfolios and eliminating one of more of the existing brand names in the process. It is one of the most powerful tools for managing the brand portfolio. Of all the moves to the brand portfolio, amalgamation is the most difficult to reverse. Therefore, it requires careful planning. Partitioning is an underutilized tool. Over time brand portfolios grow, and there comes a point when their size and breadth becomes dysfunctional. When that time comes, its time to partition. Brand portfolio managers are often naturally reluctant to partition, concerned that costs will rise, as scale is lost. Learn a lesson from financially driven positioning, the benefits of focus often outweigh the lost scale. Scaling is a two-part strategy that can drive real growth for a brand portfolio. First, it allows a brand portfolio to follow its natural market, then it fills the upmarket or downmarket void with another portfolio. To make this work, a new customer base must exist for the moved brand. Also, the upscaled or downscaled brand should be distinctive but complementary to its brethren.

My maiden name was Marthy Cannary. I was born in Princeton, Missouri, May 1st, 1852. My father and mother were natives of Ohio. I had two brothers and three sisters, I being the oldest of the children. As a child I always had a fondness for adventure and outdoor exercise and a special fondness for horses which I began to ride at an early age and continued to do so until I became an expert rider being able to ride the most vicious and stubborn of horses; in fact the greater portion of my life in early times was spent in this manner. In 1865 we emigrated from our home in Missouri by the overland route to Virginia City, Montana, taking five months to make the journey. While on the way the greater portion of my time was spent in hunting along with the men and hunters of the party. In fact I was at all times with the men when there was excitement and adventures to be had. By the time we reached Virginia City, I was considered a remarkably good shot and a fearless rider for a girl of my age. I remember many occurrences on the journey from Missouri to Montana. Many times in crossing the mountains the conditions of the trail were so bad that we frequently had to lower the wagons over ledges by hand with ropes, for they were so rough and rugged that horses were of no use. We also had many exciting times fording streams, for many of the streams in our way were noted for quicksands and boggy places, where, unless we were very careful, we would have lost horses and all. Then we had many dangers to encounter in the way of streams swelling on account of heavy rains. On occasions of that kind the men would usually select the best places to cross the streams, myself on more than one occasion having mounted my pony and swam across the stream several times merely to amuse myself, and having had', 'consumers in ways not '),

Once the telescope gathers the data, its computers turn the information into long strings of numbers that are beamed to Earth as radio signals. This information streams through a series of satellite relays to the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Then it travels by telephone line to the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. It is there that the numbers are converted back into pictures and useful data for study. The Hubble Space Telescope is named for astronomer Edwin P. Hubble. As a young boy, Hubble read tales of traveling to undersea cities and journeying to the center of the Earth. These stories by adventure novelists stoked young Hubbles imagination of faraway places. He fulfilled those childhood dreams by becoming an astronomer, exploring distant galaxies with telescopes, and developing theories that changed the field of astronomy. But Hubble didnt settle immediately on astronomy as a career. He first studied law as a Rhodes Scholar at Queens College in Oxford, England. A year after passing the bar exam, Hubble realized that his love of exploring the stars was greater than his attraction to law. He therefore abandoned law and studied astronomy at the University of Chicago, where he completed his doctoral thesis in 1917. Using the largest telescope of its day, Hubble looked far into space to study the Andromeda nebula (which we now call the Andromeda Galaxy or M31). With this powerful telescope, he saw stars near the edge of Andromeda, and he reasoned that Andromeda was a galaxy in its own right. He proved that galaxies, composed of stars and planets, exist beyond our own Milky Way. He also proved that they are distributed almost uniformly in every direction. As Hubble continued his study, he discovered that the universe is expanding. The more distant a galaxy is from Earth, the more its light is shifted toward the red end of the spectrum -- redshifted. In 1929 he determined that the more distant the galaxy from Earth, the greater its redshift, and the faster it appears to move away. Known as Hubbles Law, this discovery is the foundation of the Big Bang theory. The theory states that the universe began after a cataclysmic event in which it underwent a rapid period of inflation. The movement of the galaxies away from us is the continuation of that motion. Hubbles discovery is considered one of the greatest triumphs of 20th century astronomy. However, confirmation was difficult, until the launch of the HST. With the telescope in orbit, astronomers are getting a picture of the universe clearer than anything they could previously obtain. The telescopes stunning photos are showing the world about the wonders of space. Many of the worlds foremost astronomers are using Hubble to probe the horizons of space and time. Designed to last at least 15 years, Hubble is providing intriguing new data about black holes, the birth of galaxies, planetary systems around other stars, and, of course, the expansion of the universe. Astronomers can also get an idea of how the universe evolved. The farther away an object is, the earlier it formed after the Big Bang. Thats because the light we see now had to travel the enormous distance between the object and the Earth, and light can only travel 300,000 kilometers per second. As a result, the HSTs observations give us snapshots of the universe at different periods in its history. For example, in 1995 Hubble took a series of pictures now known as', 'day Hubble archives between '),

Much more might be said on a subject so important to the interests of the country, as well as of our university, but my wish is merely to open it for our own consideration and discussion. We have already done so much for the improvement of our system of instruction, that public opinion will not reproach us for any unwillingness to alter. It is our first duty to be well satisfied that we can improve: such alterations ought only to be the result of a most mature consideration, and of a free interchange of sentiments on the subject, in order that we may condense upon the question the accumulated judgment of many minds. It is in some measure to be attributed to the defects of our system of education, that scientific knowledge scarcely exists amongst the higher classes of society. The discussions in the Houses of Lords or of Commons, which arise on the occurrence of any subjects connected with science, sufficiently prove this fact, which, if I had consulted the extremely limited nature of my personal experience, I should, perhaps, have doubted. Interest or inclination form the primary and ruling motives in this matter, and both these exert greater or less proportionate influence in each of the respective cases to be examined. A large portion of those who are impelled by ambition or necessity to advance themselves in the world, make choice of some profession in which they imagine their talents likely to be rewarded with success; and there are peculiar advantages resulting to each from this classification of society into professions. The esprit de corps frequently overpowers the jealousy which exists between individuals, and pushes on to advantageous situations some of the more fortunate of the profession; whilst, on the other hand, any injury or insult offered to the weakest, is redressed or resented by the whole body. There are other advantages which are perhaps of more importance to the public. The numbers which compose the learned professions in England are so considerable, that a kind of public opinion is generated amongst them, which powerfully tends to repress conduct that is injurious either to the profession or to the public. Again, the mutual jealousy and rivalry excited amongst the whole body is so considerable, that although the rank and estimation which an individual holds in the profession may be most unfairly appreciated, by taking the opinion of his rival; yet few estimations will be found generally more correct than the opinion of a whole profession on the merits of any one of its body. This test is of great value to the public, and becomes the more so, in proportion to the difficulty of the study to which the profession is devoted. It is by availing themselves of it that men of sense and judgment, who have occasion for the services of professional persons, are, in a great measure, guided in their choice. The pursuit of science does not, in England, constitute a distinct profession, as it does in many other countries. It is therefore, on that ground alone, deprived', 'examinations we should, I '),

The ties which connect me with Cambridge are indeed of no ordinary kind. Taking it then for granted that our system of academical education ought to be adapted to nearly the whole of the aristocracy of the country, I am inclined to believe that whilst the modifications I should propose would not be great innovations on the spirit of our institutions, they would contribute materially to that important object. It will be readily admitted, that a degree conferred by a university, ought to be a pledge to the public that he who holds it possesses a certain quantity of knowledge. The progress of society has rendered knowledge far more various in its kinds than it used to be; and to meet this variety in the tastes and inclinations of those who come to us for instruction, we have, besides the regular lectures to which all must attend, other sources of information from whence the students may acquire sound and varied knowledge in the numerous lectures on chemistry, geology, botany, history, etc. It is at present a matter of option with the student, which, and how many of these courses he shall attend, and such it should still remain. All that it would be necessary to add would be, that previously to taking his degree, each person should be examined by those Professors, whose lectures he had attended. The pupils should then be arranged in two classes, according to their merits, and the names included in these classes should be printed. I would then propose that no young man, except his name was found amongst the "List of Honors," should be allowed to take his degree, unless he had been placed in the first class of some one at least of the courses given by the professors. But it should still be imperative upon the student to possess such mathematical knowledge as we usually require. If he had attained the first rank in several of these examinations, it is obvious that we should run no hazard in a little relaxing the strictness of his mathematical trial. If it should be thought preferable, the sciences might be grouped, and the following subjects be taken together: Modern History, Laws of England, and Civil Law; Political Economy, and Applications of Science to Arts and Manufactures; Chemistry, Mineralogy, and Geology; Zoology, including Physiology and Comparative Anatomy; and Botany, including Vegetable Physiology and Anatomy. One of the great advantages of such a system would be, that no young person would have an excuse for not studying, by stating, as is most frequently done, that the only pursuits followed at Cambridge, classics and mathematics, are not adapted either to his taste, or to the wants of his after life. His friends and relatives would then reasonably expect every student to have acquired distinction in some pursuit. If it should be feared that this plan would lead to too great a diversity of pursuits in the same individual, a limitation might be placed upon the number of examinations into which the same person might be permitted to enter. It might also be desirable not to restrict the whole of these examinations to the third year, but to allow the student to enter on some portion of them in the first or second year, if he should prefer it. By such an arrangement, which would scarcely interfere seriously with our', 'no one connected with '),
(182, 6, 3, 'odd years ago George Wright suggested to the Chairman of the old National Associations Committee of Rules that it would be a good plan to allow base runners to overrun first base, giving them the privilege to return and touch the base again without being put out, before attempting to make another base. The suggestion was adopted, and the rule went into effect in 1870, and it has been in operation ever since. When the amendment was presented at the convention of 1869, a delegate wanted the rule applied to all bases, but the majority preferred to test the experiment as proposed at first base. The rule of extending the over-running to all the bases was advocated at the last meeting in 1888 of the Joint Committee of Rules, but it was not adopted. The rule is worthy of consideration, in view of the constant sprains and injuries of one kind and another arising from sliding to bases. There has not been a single instance of an injury occurring from the working of the rule of overrunning first base since the rule was adopted, while serious injuries are of daily occurrence in match games, arising from collisions at other bases than first, and these are due entirely to the absence of the overrunning rule. The most irritating disputes caused by questions involved in sliding to bases and in running up against base players, are also due to the same cause. Why not put a stop to these injuries and these disputes by giving the base runner the same privileges in overrunning second, third, and home bases that he now has in overrunning first base? In every way will the adoption of the rule suggested be an improvement, and not the least of its advantages will be its gain to base running, which is, next to fielding, the most attractive feature of our game. The patrons of ball grounds There are two classes of the patrons of professional baseball grounds which club Presidents and Directors have their choice in catering to for each season, and these are, first, the reputable class, who prefer to see the game played scientifically and by gentlemanly exemplars of the beauties of the game; and second, the hoodlum element, who revel in noisy coaching, "dirty ball playing," kicking against the umpires, and exciting disputes and rows in every inning. The Chicago, Philadelphia, and Boston Clubs in the League have laid out nearly $200,000 within the past two years in constructing their grounds for the express purpose of eliciting the very best patronage of their respective cities. The Brooklyn Club have excelled in this respect in the American Association by constructing their grounds for a similar class of patrons. But all of the clubs have not followed this example, the majority committing the blunder of considering only the tastes and requirements of the hoodlum class apparently in catering for patronage. This is a great financial mistake. Experience has shown conclusively that it pays best to cater solely for the best class of patronage. The work in doing this is so much more satisfactory for one thing, and it is sure to be the most remunerative. If there is any sport which yields a fair equivalent in the special attractions it presents for an admission fee of half a dollar, it is such ball playing as was exhibited during the past season on the grounds of the leading clubs of the National League. A feature of the attendance at the League games of 1888 was the presence of the fair sex in such goodly numbers. Where the ladies', 'odd years ago George '),

In time, though, it may well achieve a similar status among molecular geneticists. In December 1984, a conference co-sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (or DOE) was held there, a conference that pondered a single question: Does modern DNA research offer a way of detecting tiny genetic mutations -- and, in particular, of observing any increase in the mutation rate among the survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings and their descendants? In short, the answer was, "Not yet;" however, in this atmosphere of intellectual fertility, the seeds were sown for a project that would make such detection possible in the future -- the Human Genome Project. In the months that followed, much deliberation and debate ensued. But in 1986, the DOE took a bold and unilateral step by announcing its Human Genome Initiative, convinced that its mission would be well served by a comprehensive picture of the human genome. The immediate response was considerable skepticism -- skepticism about the scientific communitys technological wherewithal for sequencing the genome at a reasonable cost, and skepticism about the value of the result, even if it could be obtained economically. Over the years, though, things have changed. Today, a worldwide effort is under way to develop and apply the technologies needed to completely map and sequence the human genome, as well as the genomes of several model organisms. Technological progress has been rapid, and it is now generally agreed that this international project will produce the complete sequence of the human genome by the year 2005, if not before. And what is more important, the value of the project is becoming evident in a wide range of areas. Genome research is revolutionizing both biology and biotechnology, and it is providing a vital thrust to the increasingly broad scope of the biological sciences. The impact that will be felt in medicine and health care alone, once we identify and understand the function of all human genes, is inestimable.

If someone else has it, theres a chance that more people will find out. Dont use easy-to-guess words or numbers, like your name or your birthday. Its easy for people to guess those.

Dont leave your machine running when youre not there. This is especially true if youre logged on to someplace secure. If you must leave your computer unattended use a screen saver with password protection for greater security. Beware of viruses and hoaxes.

Charles Babbage (1791-1871) was an English politician, philosopher, mathematician, and scientist, perhaps best known today as the "Father of Computing" for his contributions to the basic design of the computer. His observations in 1830 regarding the decline of science in the England of the time are timeless; resonating even in our "Age of Technology," they can provide us with useful insight into the way we approach this critical subject: That the state of knowledge in any country will exert a directive influence on the general system of instruction adopted in it, is a principle too obvious to require investigation. And it is equally certain that the tastes and pursuits of our manhood will bear on them the traces of the earlier impressions of our education. It is therefore not unreasonable to suppose that some portion of the neglect of science in England, may be attributed to the system of education we pursue. A young man passes from our public schools to the universities, ignorant almost of the elements of every branch of useful knowledge; and at these latter establishments, formed originally for instructing those who are intended for the clerical profession, classical and mathematical pursuits are nearly the sole objects proposed to the students ambition. Much has been done at one of our universities during the last fifteen years, to improve the system of study; and I am confident that there', 'Privacy is another issue '),

Niepce presented his first paper on the subject to the Royal Society in 1827, naming his discovery Heliography. What led him to the study of the principles of the photogenic art is unclear, but it was probably at least in part due to the previously mentioned alchemists experiments. But M. Daguerre, who is a celebrated dioramic painter, had a more easily understood motivation. He wished to employ some of the singularly changeable salts of silver to produce a peculiar class of effects in his paintings. His investigation of the method resulted in the discovery of the Daguerreotype, or photogenic drawing on plates of copper coated with silver. To this gentleman -- and to his liberality -- we Americans are indebted for the free use of his invention; and the large and increasing class of Daguerrean artists of this country should hold him in the most profound respect for it. He was not willing to see his invention confined to a few individuals who might monopolize the benefits to be derived from its practice, and thereby shut out all chance of improvement. Like a true, noble-hearted French gentleman, he wanted his invention to be spread freely throughout the entire world. With these views he opened negotiations with the French government, negotiations which benefitted both the inventors. And now France has the "glory of endowing the whole world of science and art with one of the most surprising discoveries that honor the land." Nevertheless, the invention has been patented in England, and the result is what might have been expected: English pictures are far below the standard of excellence of those taken by American artists. In addition, calotype, the name given to one of the methods of photogenic drawing on paper (discovered and perfected by Mr. Fox Talbot of England) is in precisely the same predicament, not only in that country but in the United States. Mr. Talbot is the patentee in both countries. But while he is a man of some wealth, he demands so high a price for a single right in this country, that no one is foolhardy enough to purchase one. When Mr. Talbots patent for the United States expires and our native scientists have the opportunity to proceed with improvements, it is fairly certain that the calotype, in their hands, will supercede the Daguerreotype. Let them, therefore, study the principles of the art, then experiment, practice, and perfect themselves in all its details so that they will be prepared when that day arrives. It is to Professor Samuel F. B. Morse, the distinguished inventor of the Magnetic Telegraph, of New York, that we are indebted for the application of photography to portrait taking. He was in Paris, for the purpose of presenting to the scientific world his Electro-Magnetic Telegraph, at the time (1838) M. Daguerre announced his splendid discovery; its astounding results, as well as its bearing on the art of design claimed his attention. In a letter on the subject, the Professor details the following interesting facts: "The process was a secret, and negotiations were then in progress, for the disclosure of it to the public between the French government and the distinguished discoverer. M. Daguerre had shown his results to the king, and to a few only of the distinguished savants, and by the advice of M. Arago, had determined to wait the action of the French Chambers, before showing them to any other persons. I was exceedingly desirous of seeing them, but knew not how to approach M.

Now the fun begins. Who should be listed first? With a few exceptions, theres a predetermined order. The very first credit you see on the screen, just after the lights go down and the theater informs you that this is the feature presentation and you are fortunate enough to hear it in one or another version of Dolby or THX sound, is the name of the studio (Buena Vista, Columbia, Universal, etc.). This is followed by the name of the production company that actually made the film (for example, Spielbergs Amblin Entertainment), which is then followed by the name of the investment group that hopes to make a fortune by backing the film (for example, a group of dentists in Minneapolis might call themselves "Whitecaps IV"), usually credited as "in association with." Then the directors first credit, usually "a film by (your name here)," or "a (your name) film." Then come the stars, and then comes the films title. Sometimes the stars and directors credits will be reversed, depending on the each of their deals with the studio. Then (often) come the featured actors, followed by the key production people -- the casting director, music composer, production designer, editor, director of photography and then ... And then it gets sticky. We come to the writers and producers (the director always gets the final credit). The film "Quiz Show" listed 11 producers in the opening credits, although in fact there were 14, but three had asked to have their names removed. "Daily Varietys" (one of the industrys major trade papers) story reported that "it required several weeks to work out a viable device for listing all the credits -- which would be co-producers, executive producers, ‘also produced by producers and so forth. When one refused to go along with the settlement, the entire grid had to be painstakingly reconstructed." Since no film requires 11 producers, much less 14, we can be pretty sure that were seeing ego at work. Who are these people? Often theyre friends, relatives, personal trainers, or other hangers-on of the star whose names are added on as a part of the stars contract, a kind of big perk for the "little people." When the film has two, or even three, big stars, they all may want to do this. Thus the multiplicity of producer credits. When it comes to writers, though, the situation is different and more complicated. The Writers Guild of America allows only three writing credits on a feature film, although teams of two are credited as one, separated on the credits by an ampersand ("you & I"). However, if each person works independently on the script (the most common system), the two are separated by an "and" and credited as "you and I." But wait! You wrote the story on which the script is based, so you get "story by" credit, and your credit for the screenplay precedes mine, even if I wrote most of the script, except that if my script made substantial changes to your story, Ill get first "screenplay by" credit. If more than two of us worked on the screenplay, the credits will probably read something like "screenplay by you & I and he and she." You and I worked as a team, but he and she worked separately. It actually does have a certain logic to it, when you think about it. After all, the movie "The Flintstones" had, by', 'up to half the '),

Here, however, terminated the experiment; for although both Mr. Wedgwood and Sir Humphry Davey experimented carefully, for the purpose of endeavoring to fix the drawings thus obtained, yet the object could not be accomplished, and the whole ended in failure." This, by their own showing, was the earliest attempt of the English experimenters. But this much of the principle was known to the alchemists at a much earlier date, although the experiment was carried out in a practically different manner, as the following description amply proves: "Dissolve chalk in aquafortis to the consistency of milk, and add to it a strong solution of silver; keep this liquor in a glass bottle well stopped; then cutting out from a piece of paper the letters you would have appear, paste it on the decanter, and lay it in the suns rays in such a manner that the rays may pass through the spaces cut out of the paper and fall on the surface of the liquor the part of the glass through which the rays pass will be turned black, while that under the paper remains white; but particular care must be observed that the bottle be not moved during the operation." The alchemists became so intent on discovering the far-famed philosophers stone that they were unmindful of the accidental occurrence of more valuable discoveries. If they had not, then this little experiment in chemistry might have induced them to conduct a more thorough search into the principle. In that case, photogenic art would not now be claimed as a new discovery. Many individuals even assert that the Jugglers of India possessed a great secret for quite some time, a secret by which they were enabled, in a brief space, to copy the likeness of any individual by the action of light. This fact, if it is truly fact and not a myth, may account for the celebrated magic mirrors said to be possessed by these jugglers, and it was the probable cause of their power over the rest of the people. However, as early as 1556 experimenters established, as fact, that a combination of chloride and silver, called horn silver, from its appearance, could become blackened by the suns rays. Then, in the latter part of the last century, a Mrs. Fulhame published an experiment by she effected a change in color of gold chloride, also by means of light. She concluded that, in her opinion, words might be someday be written in this way. These incidents are considered as the first steps towards the discovery of the photogenic art. Mr. Wedgwoods experiments can scarcely be said to be any improvement on either of these instances, since he failed to bring them to practical usefulness; his countrymen will have to be satisfied with awarding the honor of its complete adaptation for practical purposes, to MM. Niepce and Daguerre of France and to Professors Draper and Morse of New York. MM.

Later, once they have found a specific field of interest, they can begin to focus on that. But theres more than book learning involved. Other skills Bolden feels are integral to becoming an astronaut are: being able to work as a team player; understanding and appreciating your ethnic, cultural, and American history; and maintaining a grasp on current events. Bolden does not hold the opinion that Americas young people are less equipped than their foreign counterparts. "I listen to people say that American students cant do this and cant do that. I dont buy into or accept that at all. Kids are just as sharp as when I came up. Its just motivation that may be lacking," Bolden said. It is also interesting to note that out of 195 former and present astronauts, 123 (64%) have taken part in some form of scouting. Scouting develops a sense of discipline, as well as particular skills. Both are crucial to becoming part of the astronaut team. Once students reach high school, it is particularly important that they earn the best possible grades as well as high standardized test scores (SAT and/or ACT). NASA looks for the best and the brightest, so it makes sense that they would look at how well students apply themselves to their studies. At this point, too, students should begin to think about a specific direction of study, such as engineering, biological or physical science, or mathematics. This will help them direct their education once they get to college. Again, though, books are only part of the process. Its a good idea to look for out-of-school opportunities like internships or apprenticeships, summer programs, and fieldwork, to help balance textbook learning. After all, going into space is a real-world -- not a virtual -- experience; the more experience you bring to it, the better youll be able to deal with the demands of the job. Internships are also a good way of finding out if your career choice is the right one for you. Many students, when faced with the realities of a particular field, decide its not what they wanted, after all. Its better to decide early on that this is the case, before you devote a lot of time and effort to something you dont enjoy. But choose your activities wisely. "If you do things thinking that, This will look good on a resume, or Im not going to like it but itll help me get selected someday, you will do yourself a disservice. Youre not going to do as well as you would at something in which youre interested," said Reightler. The "minimum degree requirement" for an astronaut is a Bachelors degree from an accredited institution. Three years of related increasingly responsible professional experience must follow that degree. Most astronauts to date, however, have continued with their education to the post-graduate (Masters and Ph.D.) levels; they have been able to substitute that education for all or part of their work experience requirement. NASA contributes funds to 51 colleges and universities through its Space Grant Consortia. If you attend one of these institutions, you are ensured that the curriculum for space programs will conform with the guidelines NASA finds acceptable. However, you can attend any college or university that you wish, since almost all offer degrees in technical fields, math, and science. You should check with a guidance/college counselor -- and NASA -- before you go to confirm that the school will offer the', 'without math and science '),

And for another, NASA needs applicants who can demonstrate success at the higher-education levels. Math and science are obviously critical to becoming an astronaut, but they are not the only subjects you will need to get where youre going. English -- an ability to communicate, both written and verbally -- is also vital. So is history, not just of the space program, but of the world. And Bolden, who had to wake up extra early to attend a class in basic Russian language to prepare for his mission with a cosmonaut, suggests that every American should be -- at the very least -- bilingual. "Space," he says, "is a multinational and multicultural operation. Working with Russian cosmonauts is very difficult if astronauts dont know anything about Russian culture and their history as a people." This is also increasingly true as construction of the International Space Station gets underway. But, says Dr. Ellen Ochoa, a Mission Specialist and the first Hispanic woman in space, "there isnt one particular type of work experience that NASA is looking for. NASA -- like any other employer -- wants to know how well a person has done. If you come from a research background, theyd look at published work in technical journals, lecturing or TA experience, and also any awards that you may have won. Everyone should have summer jobs. You need some sort of experience." College-level experience will also help you to understand what particular companies are looking for in terms of hiring policies and experience levels. And many students are offered jobs, either when their internship is completed or upon graduation. So now that youve got the degree and some experience, how do you qualify to become an astronaut? The first step is to fill out an application -- specifically, U.S. Government Form 171, which you send to the Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas. There it will be reviewed and ranked according to height considerations (you must be at least 58.5 inches), experience, and expertise (i.e. geologists, physicists, chemists, biologists etc.). The competition is fierce -- about 4,000 individuals apply every two years, and the slots are limited. And if the applicant is looking for a pilot/commander position in the program, then he/she must also be prepared to log in at least 1,000 hours of flight time in command of a jet aircraft prior to consideration. Most of the current and former pilot/commander positions have been filled historically by men who have served or are currently active in the United States Armed Forces. There are only a few exceptions. During training all crew members will train aboard a T-38 jet. The controls are identical to that of the Space Shuttle and, therefore, the jet can be used as a flight simulator either on the ground or in actual flight. Once the initial ranking is complete, the applications go through a second, more stringent, round to narrow down the field. From the initial 4,000 applicants, only about 118 are asked to come to the JSC and undergo a week of interviews, medical examinations, and basic orientation. Ochoa noted that the Astronaut Selection Board (ASB) generally looks for people who have done very well in a technical field. And very well does not mean just their grades -- candidates should make sure they have sterling recommendations, especially from undergraduate and graduate school professors who can attest to their problem solving', 'you need Regardless of '),

Here is "This Land" boiled down first to half tones, then to four whole tones, then to only two whole tones The whole passage is basically a fancy way of getting from C to B. We hear the reductional structure of a melody in the chords of the rhythm guitar line. We also hear it when the band accompanying a tap dancer plays one of the stanzas in stop time, striking a single note in place of an entire line of music so that the tapping is easier to hear. And we sense it when we recognize variations of a piece in classical music or jazz. The skeleton of the melody is conserved while the ornaments differ from variation to variation. Jackendoff and Lerdahl propose that there are in fact two ways that melodies may be dissected into simpler and simpler skeletons. I have shown you the first way, the time-span reduction, which lines up with the grouping and metrical structures and designates some of the groups and beats as ornaments on others. Jackendoff and Lerdahl call the second one a prolongation reduction. It captures the sense of musical flow across phrases, the buildup and release of tension within longer and longer passages over the course of the piece, culminating in a feeling of 534 I maximum repose at the end. Tension builds up as the melody departs from the more stable notes to the less stable notes, and is discharged when the melody returns to the stable ones. The contours of tension and release are also defined by changes from dissonant to consonant chords, from nonaccented to accented notes, from higher to lower notes, and from prolonged to nonprolonged notes. The musicologist Deryck Cooke worked out a theory of the emotional semantics of the prolongation reduction. He showed how music conveys tension and resolution by transitions across unstable and stable intervals, and conveys joy and sorrow by transitions across major and minor intervals. Simple motifs of only four or five notes, he said, convey feelings like "innocent, blessed joy," "demonic horror," "continuous pleasurable longing," and "a burst of anguish." Longer stretches, and passages with motifs within motifs, can convey intricate patterns of feeling. One passage, as Cooke analyzes it, expresses "the feeling of a passionate outburst of painful emotion, which does not protest further, but falls back into acceptance a flow and ebb of grief. Being neither complete protest nor complete acceptance, it has an effect of restless sorrow." Cooke supports his analyses with lists of examples that have a consensus interpretation, many with lyrics that offer additional corroboration. Some musicologists scoff at theories like Cookes, finding counterexamples to every claim. But the exceptions tend to come from fine classical music, which uses interleaved, embedded, and ambiguous lines to challenge simple expectations and engage a sophisticated listener. Cookes particular analyses may be debatable, but his main idea that there are lawful connections between patterns of intervals and patterns of emotion is clearly on the right track. So that is the basic design of music. But if music confers no survival advantage, where does it come from and why does it work? I suspect that music is auditory cheesecake, an exquisite confection crafted to tickle the sensitive spots of at least six of our mental faculties. A standard piece tickles them all at once, but we can see the ingredients in various kinds of not-quite-music that leave one or more of them out. 1. Language.', 'a bare skeleton of '),

And preschoolers think that one species can be turned into another only when the transformation affects a permanent part of the animals constitution, not when it merely alters appearance. For example, they deny that a lion costume turns a tiger into a lion. They claim that if you remove the innards of a dog, the shell that remains, while looking like a dog, is not a dog and cant bark or eat dogfood. But if you remove the outsides of a dog, leaving something that doesnt look like a dog at all, its still a dog and does doggy things. Preschoolers even have a crude sense of inheritance. Told that a piglet is being raised by cows, they know it will grow up to oink, not moo. Children do not merely sort animals like baseball cards but use their categories to reason about how animals work. In one experiment, threeyear- olds were shown pictures of a flamingo, a blackbird, and a bat that looked a lot like the blackbird. The children were told that flamingos feed their babies mashed-up food but bats feed their babies milk, and were asked what they thought the blackbird feeds its babies. With no further information, children went with appearances and said that blackbirds, like bats, give milk. But if they were told that a flamingo is a bird, the children thought of them as working like blackbirds, despite their Good Ideas 327 different appearance, and guessed that blackbirds provide their babies with mashed-up food, too. Children also have a sense that a living things properties are there to keep it alive and help it function. Three-year-olds say that a rose has thorns because it helps the rose, but not that barbed wire has barbs to help the wire. They say that claws are good for the lobster, but not that jaws are good for the pliers. This sense of fitness or adaptation is not just a confusion between psychological wants and biological functions. The psychologists Giyoo Hatano and Kayoko Inagaki have shown that children have a clear sense that bodily processes are involuntary. They know that a boy cant digest dinner more quickly to make room for dessert, nor can he make himself fat by wishing alone. Is essentialism learned? Biological processes are too slow and hidden to show to a bored baby, but testing babies is only one way to show knowledge in the absence of experience. Another is to measure the source of the experience itself. Three-year-olds havent taken biology, and they have few opportunities to experiment with the innards or the heritability of animals. Whatever they have learned about essences has presumably come from their parents. Gelman and her students analyzed more than four thousand sentences from mothers talking to their children about animals and artifacts. The parents virtually never talked about innards, origins, or essences, and the few times they did, it was about the innards of artifacts. Children are essentialists without their parents help. Artifacts come with being human. We make tools, and as we evolved our tools made us. One-year-old babies are fascinated by what objects can do for them. They tinker obsessively with sticks for pushing, cloth and strings for pulling, and supports for holding things up. As soon as they can be tested on tool use, around eighteen months, children show an understanding that tools have to contact their material and that a tools rigidity and shape are more important than its color or ornamentation.

New habitats can be colonized because even if their local conditions differ, they obey the laws of physics and biology that are already within humans ken, and can be exploited and outsmarted in their turn. Revenge of the Nerds 191 WHY US? Why did some miocene ape first enter the cognitive niche? Why not a groundhog, or a catfish, or a tapeworm? It only happened once, so no one knows. But I would guess that our ancestors had four traits that made it especially easy and worth their while to evolve better powers of causal reasoning. First, primates are visual animals. In monkeys such as the rhesus macaque, half the brain is dedicated to sight. Stereoscopic vision, the use of differences in the vantage points of the two eyes to give a sense of depth, developed early in the primate lineage, allowing early nocturnal primates to move among treacherous fine branches and to grab insects with their hands. Color vision accompanied the switch of the ancestors of monkeys and apes to the day shift and their new taste for fruits, which advertise their ripeness with gaudy hues. Why would the vision thing make such a difference? Depth perception defines a three-dimensional space filled with movable solid objects. Color makes objects pop out from their backgrounds, and gives us a sensation that corresponds to the stuff an object is made of, distinct from our perception of the shape of the stuff. Together they have pushed the primate brain into splitting the flow of visual information into two streams: a "what" system, for objects and their shapes and compositions, and a "where" system, for their locations and motions. It cant be a coincidence that the human mind grasps the world even the most abstract, ethereal concepts as a space filled with movable things and stuff (see Chapters 4 and 5). We say that John went from being sick to being well, even if he didnt move an inch; he could have been in bed the whole time. Mary can give him many pieces of advice, even if they merely talked on the phone and nothing changed hands. Even scientists, when they try to grasp abstract mathematical relationships, plot them in graphs that show them as two- and three-dimensional shapes. Our capacity for abstract thought has co-opted the coordinate system and inventory of objects made available by a well-developed visual system. It is harder to see how a standard mammal could have moved in that direction. Most mammals hug the ground sniffing the rich chemical tracks and trails left behind by other living things. Anyone who has 192 I walked a frisky cocker spaniel as it explores the invisible phantasmagoria on a sidewalk knows that it lives in an olfactory world beyond our understanding. Here is an exaggerated way of stating the difference. Rather than living in a three-dimensional coordinate space hung with movable objects, standard mammals live in a two-dimensional flatland which they explore through a zero-dimensional peephole. Edwin Abbotts Flatland, a mathematical novel about the denizens of a plane, showed that a twodimensional world differs from our own in ways other than just lacking one third of the usual dimensions. Many geometric arrangements are simply impossible. A full-faced human figure has no way of getting food into his mouth, and a profiled one would be divided into two pieces by his digestive tract. Simple devices like tubes, knots, and wheels with axles are unbuildable. If most mammals think in a cognitive flatland, they', 'a concern of both '),
(193, 17, 3, 'a cuckolded consort The female bird is adulterous because she has a chance of getting the best of both worlds: the genes of the fittest male and the investment of the most willing male. The victim of cuckoldry is worse off than if he had failed to breed at all, because he has devoted his worldly efforts to the genes of a competitor. So in species whose males invest, the males jealousy is directed not only at rival males but at the female. He may guard her, follow her around, copulate repeatedly, and avoid females that show signs of having recently mated. Xhe human mating system is not like any other animals. But that does not mean it escapes the laws governing mating systems, which have been documented in hundreds of species. Any gene predisposing a male to be cuckolded, or a female to receive less paternal help than her neighbors, would quickly be tossed from the gene pool. Any gene that allowed a male to impregnate all the females, or a female to bear the most indulged offspring of the best male, would quickly take over. These selection pressures are not small. For human sexuality to be "socially constructed" and independent of biology, as the popular academic view has it, not only must it have miraculously escaped these powerful pressures, but it must have withstood equally powerful pressures of a different kind. If a person played out a socially constructed role, other people could shape the role to prosper at his or her expense. Powerful men could brainwash the others to enjoy being celibate or cuckolded, leaving the women for them. Any willingness to accept socially constructed gender roles would be selected out, and genes for resisting the roles would take over. 468 What kind of animal is Homo sapiens"? We are mammals, so a womans minimum parental investment is much larger than a mans. She contributes nine months of pregnancy and (in a natural environment) two to four years of nursing. He contributes a few minutes of sex and a teaspoon of semen. Men are about 1.15 times as large as women, which tells us that they have competed in our evolutionary history, with some men mating with several women and some men mating with none. Unlike gibbons, who are isolated, monogamous, and relatively sexless, and gorillas, who are clustered, harem-forming, and relatively sexless, we are gregarious, with men and women living together in large groups and constantly facing opportunities to couple. Men have smaller testicles for their body size than chimpanzees but bigger ones than gorillas and gibbons, suggesting that ancestral women were not wantonly promiscuous but were not always monogamous either. Children are born helpless and remain dependent on adults for a large chunk of the human lifespan, presumably because knowledge and skills are so important to the human way of life. So children need parental investment, and men, because they get meat from hunting and other resources, have something to invest. Men far exceed the minimum investment that their anatomy would let them get away with: they feed, protect, and teach their children. That should make cuckoldry a concern to men, and a mans willingness and ability to invest in children a concern to women. Because men and women live together in large groups, like chimps, but the males invest in their offspring, like birds, we developed marriage, in which a man and woman form a reproductive alliance that is meant to limit demands from third parties for sexual access and parental investment. These facts of life have never changed, but others have. Until recently,', 'a cuckolded consort The '),

Our geographic knowledge is not a big mental map but a set of smaller maps, organized by assertions about how they are related. Finally, images cannot serve as our concepts, nor can they serve as the meanings of words in the mental dictionary. A long tradition in empiricist philosophy and psychology tried to argue that they could, since it fit the dogma that there is nothing in the intellect that was not previously in the senses. Images were supposed to be degraded or superimposed copies of visual sensations, the sharp edges sanded off and the colors blended together so that they could stand for entire categories rather than individual objects. As long as you dont think too hard about what these composite images look like, the idea has a ring of plausibility. But then, how would one represent abstract ideas, even something as simple as the concept of a triangle? A triangle is any three-sided polygon. But any image of a triangle must be isosceles, scalene, or equilateral. John Locke made the enigmatic claim that our image of a triangle is "all and none of these at once." Berkeley called him on it, challenging his readers to form a mental image of a triangle that was isosceles, scalene, equilateral, and none of the above, all at the same time. But rather than abandoning the theory that abstract ideas are images, Berkeley concluded that we dont have abstract ideas! Early in the twentieth century, Edward Titchener, one of Americas first experimental psychologists, rose to the challenge. By carefully introspecting on his own images, he argued that they could represent any idea, no matter how abstract: I can quite well get Lockes picture, the triangle that is no triangle and all triangles at one and the same time.

Natural selection, however, did not shape us to earn good grades in science class or to publish in refereed journals. It shaped us to master the local environment, and that led to discrepancies between how we naturally think and what is demanded in the academy.

Subject: The day Flumo was drinking the cane juice Yakpalo was not there on that day. Experimenter: What is the reason? Subject: The reason is that Yakpalo went to his farm on that day and Flumo remained in town on that day. The example is not atypical; Coles subjects often say things like "Yakpalo isnt here at the moment; why dont you go and ask him about the matter?" The psychologist Ulric Neisser, who excerpted this dialogue, notes that these answers are by no means stupid. They are just not answers to the experimenters question. A ground rule when you solve a problem at school is to base your reasoning on the premises mentioned in a question, ignoring everything else you know. The attitude is important in modem schooling. In the few thousand years since the emergence of civilizations, a division of labor has allowed a class of knowledge professionals to develop methods of inference that are widely applicable and can be disseminated by writing and formal instruction. These methods literally have no content. Long division can calculate miles per gallon, or it can calculate income per capita. Logic can tell you that Socrates is mortal, or, in the examples in Lewis Carrolls logic textbook, that no lamb is accustomed to smoking cigars, all pale people are phlegmatic, and a lame puppy would not say "thank you" if you offered to lend it a skipping rope. The statistical tools of experimental psychology were borrowed from agronomy, where they were invented to gauge the effects of different fertilizers on crop yields. The tools work just fine in psychology, even though, as one psychological statistician wrote, "we do not deal in manure, at least not knowingly." The power of these tools is that they can be applied to any problem how color vision works, how to put a man on the moon, whether mitochondrial Eve was an African no matter how ignorant one is at the outset. To master the techniques, students must feign the ignorance they will later be saddled with when solving problems in their professional lives.

The closest equivalent for our ancestors would have been hearsay of unknown validity, transmitted with coarse labels like probably. Our ancestors usable probabilities must have come from their own experience, and that means they were frequencies: over the years, five out of the eight people who came down with a purple rash died the following day. Gigerenzer, Cosmides, Tooby, and the psychologist Klaus Fiedler noticed that the medical decision problem and the Linda problem ask for single-event probabilities: how likely is that this patient is sick, how likely is it that Linda is a bankteller. A probability instinct that worked in relative frequencies might find the questions beyond its ken. Theres only one Linda, and either she is a bankteller or she isnt. "The probability that she is a bankteller" is uncomputable. So they gave people the vexing problems but stated them in terms of frequencies, not single348 event probabilities. One out of a thousand Americans has the disease; fifty out of a thousand healthy people test positive; we assembled a thousand Americans; how many who test positive have the disease? A hundred people fit Lindas description; how many are banktellers; how many are feminist banktellers? Now a majority of people up to ninety-two percent behave like good statisticians. This cognitive therapy has enormous implications. Many men who test positive for HIV (the AIDS virus) assume they are doomed. Some have taken extreme measures, including suicide, despite their surely knowing that most men dont have AIDS (especially men who do not fall into a known risk group) and that no test is perfect. But it is hard for doctors and patients to use that knowledge to calibrate the chance of being infected, even when the probabilities are known. For example, in recent years the prevalence of HIV in German men who do not belong to a risk group is 0.01%, the sensitivity (hit rate) of a typical HIV test is 99.99%, and the false positive rate is perhaps 0.01%. The prospects of a patient who has tested positive do not sound very good. But now imagine that a doctor counseled a patient as follows: "Think of 10,000 heterosexual men like you. We expect one to be infected with the virus, and he will almost certainly test positive. Of the 9,999 men who are not infected, one additional man will test positive. Thus we get two who test positive, but only one of them actually has the virus. All we know at this point is that you have tested positive. So the chance that you actually have the virus is about 50 50." Gigerenzer has found that when probabilities are presented in this way (as frequencies), people, including specialists, are vastly more accurate at estimating the probability of a disease following a medical test. The same is true for other judgments under uncertainty, such as guilt in a criminal trial. Gigerenzer argues that peoples intuitive equation of probability with frequency not only makes them calculate like statisticians, it! makes them think like statisticians about the concept of probability itself a surprisingly slippery and paradoxical notion.

(197, 21, 3, 'across time cultures and subcultures And music communicates nothing but formless emotion. Even a plot as simple as "Boy meets girl, boy loses girl" cannot be narrated by a sequence of tones in any musical idiom. All this suggests that music is quite different from language and that it is a technology, not an adaptation. But there are some parallels. As we shall see, music may borrow some of the mental software for language. And just as the worlds languages conform to an abstract Universal Grammar, the worlds musical idioms conform to an abstract Universal Musical Grammar. That idea was first broached by the composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein in The Unanswered Question, a passionate attempt to apply Noam Chomskys ideas to music. The richest theory of universal musical grammar has been worked out by Ray Jackendoff in collaboration with the music theorist Fred Lerdahl and incorporating the ideas of many musicologists before them, most prominently Heinrich Schenker. According to the theory, music is built from an inventory of notes and a set of rules. The rules assemble notes into a sequence and organize them into three hierarchical structures, all superimposed on the same string of notes. To understand a musical piece means to assemble these mental structures as we listen to the piece. The building blocks of a musical idiom are its inventory of notes roughly, the different sounds that a musical instrument is designed to emit. The notes are played and heard as discrete events with beginnings and ends and a target pitch or coloring. That sets music apart from most other streams of sound, which slide continuously up or down, such as a howling wind, an engine roar, or the intonation of speech. The notes differ in how stable they feel to a listener. Some give a feeling of finality or settledness, and are suitable endings of a composition. Others feel unstable, and when they are played the listener feels a tension that is resolved when the piece returns to a more stable note. In some musical 530 idioms, the notes are drumbeats with different timbres (coloring or quality). In others, the notes are pitches that are arrayed from high to low but not placed at precise intervals. But in many idioms the notes are tones of a fixed pitch; we label ours "do, re, mi,. . ." or "C, D, E, . . ." The musical significance of a pitch cannot be defined in absolute terms, but only by an interval between it and a reference pitch, usually the stablest one in the set. The human sense of pitch is determined by the frequency of vibration of the sound. In most forms of tonal music, the notes in the inventory are related to the frequencies of vibration in a straightforward way. When an object is set into a sustained vibration (a string is plucked, a hollow object is struck, a column of air reverberates), the object vibrates at several frequencies at once. The lowest and often loudest frequency the fundamental generally determines the pitch we hear, but the object also vibrates at twice the fundamental frequency (but typically not as intensely), at three times the frequency (even less intensely), at four times (less intensely still), and so on. These vibrations are called harmonics or overtones. They are not perceived as pitches distinct from the fundamental, but when they are all heard together they give a note its richness or timbre. But now imagine disassembling a complex tone and playing each of its overtones separately and at the same volume. Say the fundamental frequency is 64 vibrations a', 'across time cultures and '),

As with displays of anger, sympathy, shame, and fear, the brain is going to some effort to convince an audience that an internal state is heartfelt rather than a sham. Laughter appears to have homologues in other primate species. The human ethologist Irenaus Eibl-Eibesfeldt hears the rhythmic noise of laughter in the mobbing call that monkeys give when they gang up to threaten or attack a common enemy. Chimpanzees make a different noise that primatologists describe as laughter. It is a breathy pant made both when exhaling and when inhaling, and it sounds more like sawing wood than like the exhaled ha-ha-ha of human laughter. (There may be other kinds of chimpanzee laughter as well.) Chimps "laugh" when they tickle each other, just as children do. Tickling consists of touching vulnerable parts of the body during a mock attack. Many primates, and children in all societies, engage in rough-and-tumble play as practice for fighting. Play fighting poses a dilemma for the fighters: the scuffling should be realistic enough to serve as a useful rehearsal for offense and defense, but each party wants the other to know the attack is a sham so the fight doesnt escalate and do real damage. Chimp laughter and other primate play faces have evolved as a signal that the aggression is, as we say, all in fun. So we have two candidates for precursors to laughter: a signal of collective aggression and a signal of mock aggression. They are not mutually exclusive, and both may shed light on humor in humans. The Meaning of Life j 547 Humor is often a kind of aggression. Being laughed at is aversive and feels like an attack. Comedy often runs on slapstick and insult, and in less refined settings, including the foraging societies in which we evolved, humor can be overtly sadistic. Children often laugh hysterically when other children hurt themselves or suffer misfortune. Many reports in the literature on humor among foragers are similar. When the anthropologist Raymond Hames was living with the YeKwana in the Amazon rainforest, he once smacked his head on the crossbar of the entrance to a hut and crumpled to the ground, bleeding profusely and writhing in pain. The onlookers were doubled over in laughter. Not that we are all that different. Executions in England used to be occasions for the whole family to turn out and laugh at the condemned man as he was led to the gallows and hanged.

He believes that an ordinary civilized stockbroker can really produce out of his own inside noises which denote all the mysteries of memory and all the agonies of desire. When English-speakers hear the word Schadenfreude for the first time, their reaction is not, "Let me seePleasure in anothers misfortunesWhat could that possibly be? I cannot grasp the concept; my language and culture have not provided me with such a category." Their reaction is, You mean theres a word for it? Cool!" That is surely what went through the minds of the writers who introduced Schadenfreude into written English a century ago. New emotion words catch on quickly, without tortuous definitions; they come from other languages (ennui, angst, naches, amok), from subcultures such as those of musicians and drug addicts (blues, funk, juiced, wasted, rush, high, freaked out), and from general slang (pissed, bummed, grossed out, blown away). I have never heard a foreign emotion word whose meaning was not instantly recognizable. Peoples emotions are so alike that it takes a philosopher to craft a genuinely alien one. In an essay called "Mad Pain and Martian Pain," David Lewis defines mad pain as follows: There might be a strange man who sometimes feels pain, just as we do, but whose pain differs greatly from ours in its causes and effects. Our pain is typically caused by cuts, burns, pressure, and the like; his is caused by moderate exercise on an empty stomach. Our pain is generally distracting; his turns his mind to mathematics, facilitating concentration on that but distracting him from anything else. Intense pain has no ten368 dency whatever to cause him to groan or writhe, but does cause him to cross his legs and snap his fingers. He is not in the least motivated to prevent pain or to get rid of it. Have anthropologists discovered a people that feels mad pain or something equally weird? It might seem that way if you look only at stimulus and response. The anthropologist Richard Shweder points out, "It is a trivial exercise for any anthropologist to generate long lists of antecedent events (ingesting cow urine, eating chicken five days after your father dies, kissing the genitals of an infant boy, being complimented about your pregnancy, caning a child, touching someones foot or shoulder, being addressed by your first name by your wife, ad infinitum) about which the emotional judgments of a Western observer would not correspond to the natives evaluative response." True enough, but if you look a bit deeper and ask how people categorize these stimuli, the emotions elicited by the categories make you feel at home. To us, cow urine is a contaminant and cow mammary secretions are a nutrient; in another culture, the categories may be reversed, but we all feel disgust for contaminants. To us, being addressed by your first name by a spouse is not disrespectful, but being addressed by your first name by a stranger might be, and being addressed by your religion by your spouse might be, too. In all the cases, disrespect triggers anger. But what about the claims of native informants that they just dont have one of our emotions? Do our emotions seem like mad pain to them? Probably not. The Utku-Inuits claim that they do not feel anger is belied by their behavior: they recognize anger in foreigners, beat their dogs to discipline them, squeeze their children painfully hard, and occasionally get "heated up."

Bereaved people find that they ache all over again every time they discover another habit to unlearn, like setting out an extra plate or buying groceries for two. And blaming oneself is a common symptom. But the pain of grief makes planning harder, not easier, and is too extreme and long-lasting to be useful as a strategy session. William James wrote, "It takes a mind debauched by learning to carry the process of making the natural seem strange so far as to ask for the why of any instinctive human act." Though legitimate to a scientist, the question "Why do we grieve?" is preposterous to common sense. If Hotheads 421 you didnt grieve when someone died, could you really have loved him when he was alive? Its logically possible but seems psychologically impossible; grief is the other side of love. And there may lie the answer. Perhaps grief is an internal doomsday machine, pointless once it goes off, useful only as a deterrent. What parents have not lain awake contemplating the horror of losing a child? Or worried themselves sick with awful images when a child is late or lost? These thoughts are powerful reminders to protect and cherish a loved one in the face of myriad other demands on ones time and thoughts. Like all deterrents, grief would be effective only if it is certain and terrible. KIDDING OURSELVES The playwright Jerome K. Jerome once said, "It is always the best policy to tell the truth, unless, of course, you are an exceptionally good liar." Its hard to be a good liar, even when it comes to your own intentions, which only you can verify. Intentions come from emotions, and emotions have evolved displays on the face and body. Unless you are a master of the Stanislavsky method, you will have trouble faking them; in fact, they probably evolved because they were hard to fake. Worse, lying is stressful, and anxiety has its own telltale markers. They are the rationale for polygraphs, the so-called lie detectors, and humans evolved to be lie detectors, too. Then there is the annoying fact that some propositions logically entail others. Since some of the things you say will be true, you are always in danger of exposing your own lies. As the Yiddish saying goes, a liar must have a good memory. Trivers, pursuing his theory of the emotions to its logical conclusion, notes that in a world of walking lie detectors the best strategy is to believe your own lies. You cant leak your hidden intentions if you dont think that they are your intentions. According to his theory of self-deception, the conscious mind sometimes hides the truth from itself the better to hide it from others. But the truth is useful, so it should be registered somewhere in the mind, walled off from the parts that interact with other people. There is an obvious similarity to Freuds theory of the unconscious and the defense mechanisms of the ego (such as repression, projection, denial, and rationalization), though the explanation is completely different. George Orwell stated it in 1984: "The secret of ruler422 I ship is to combine a belief in ones own infallibility with a power to learn from past mistakes."

A hundred million trillion sentence meanings cannot be squeezed into a brain with a hundred billion neurons if each meaning must have its own neuron. But even if they did fit, a complex thought is surely not stored whole, one thought per neuron. The clues come from the way our thoughts are related to one another. Imagine that each thought had its own unit. There would have to be separate units for the baby eating the slug, the slug eating the baby, the chicken eating the slug, the chicken eating the baby, the slug eating the chicken, the baby seeing the slug, the slug seeing the baby, the chicken seeing the slug, and so on. Units have to be assigned to all of these thoughts and many more; any human being capable of thinking the thought that the baby saw the chicken is also capable of thinking the thought that the chicken saw the baby. But there is something suspicious about this inventory of thought-units; it is shot through with coincidences. Over and over again we have babies eating, slugs eating, babies seeing, slugs seeing, and so on. The thoughts perfectly slot themselves into the rows, columns, layers, hyper-rows, hyper-columns, and hyperlayers of a vast matrix. But this striking pattern is baffling if thoughts are 120 just a very big collection of separate units; the units could just as easily have represented an inventory of isolated factoids that had nothing do with one another. When nature presents us with objects that perfectly fill a rectangular bank of pigeonholes, its telling us that the objects must be built out of smaller components which correspond to the rows and the columns. Thats how the periodic table of the elements led to an understanding of the structure of the atom. For similar reasons we can conclude that the warp and weft of our thinkable thoughts are the concepts composing them. Thoughts are assembled out of concepts; they are not stored whole. Compositionality is surprisingly tricky for connectoplasm. All the obvious tricks turn out to be inadequate halfway measures. Suppose we dedicate each unit to a combination of one concept and one role. Perhaps one unit would stand for baby-eats and another for slug-is-eaten, or perhaps one unit would stand for baby-does-something and another for slug-has-something-done-to-it. This cuts down the number of combinations considerably but at the cost of reintroducing befuddlement about who did what to whom. The thought "The baby ate the chicken when the poodle ate the slug" would be indistinguishable from the thought "The baby ate the slug when the poodle ate the chicken." The problem is that a unit for baby-eats does not say what it ate, and a unit for slug-iseaten does not say who ate it. A step in the right direction is to build into the hardware a distinction between the concepts (baby, slug, and so on) and the roles they play (actor, acted upon, and so on). Suppose we set up separate pools of units, one for the role of actor, one for the action, one for the role of acted upon. To represent a proposition, each pool of units is filled with the pattern for the concept currently playing the role, shunted in from a separate memory store for concepts. If we connected every node to every other node, we would have an auto-associator for propositions, and it could achieve a modicum of facility with combinatorial thoughts.

After wounding staff members who tried to tackle him, he ran to the gymnasium, where a kindergarten class was playing. There he shot twenty-eight children, sixteen fatally, and killed their teacher before turning the gun on himself. "Evil visited us yesterday, and we dont know why," said the schools headmaster the next day. "We dont understand it and I dont think we ever will." We probably never will understand what made Hamilton commit his vile final acts. But the report of pointless revenge by an embittered loner is disturbingly familiar. Hamilton was a suspected pedophile who had been forced to resign as a Scout leader and then formed his own youth groups so he could continue working with boys. One group held its meetings in the Dunblane schools gymnasium until school officials, responding to parents complaints about his odd behavior, forced him out. Hamilton was the target of ridicule and gossip, and was known in the area, undoubtedly for good reasons, as "Mr. Creepy." Days before his rampage he had sent letters to the media and to Queen Elizabeth defending his reputation and pleading for reinstatement in the scouting movement. The Dunblane tragedy was particularly shocking because no one thought it could happen there. Dunblane is an idyllic, close-knit village where serious crime was unknown. It is far from America, land of the wackos, where there are as many guns as people and where murderous rampages by disgruntled postal workers are so common (a dozen inci- 363 364 I dents in a dozen years) that a slang term for losing ones temper is "going postal." But running amok is not unique to America, to Western nations, or even to modern societies. Amok is a Malay word for the homicidal sprees occasionally undertaken by lonely Indochinese men who have suffered a loss of love, a loss of money, or a loss of face. The syndrome has been described in a culture even more remote from the West: the stone-age foragers of Papua New Guinea. The amok man is patently out of his mind, an automaton oblivious to his surroundings and unreachable by appeals or threats. But his rampage is preceded by lengthy brooding over failure, and is carefully planned as a means of deliverance from an unbearable situation. The amok state is chillingly cognitive. It is triggered not by a stimulus, not by a tumor, not by a random spurt of brain chemicals, but by an', 'and admired he was '),

Odysseus had his crewmates plug their ears with wax and tie him to the mast so he could hear the Sirens alluring song and not steer the ship toward them and onto the rocks. Though myopic discounting remains unexplained, Schelling captures something important about its psychology when he roots the paradox of self-control in the modularity of the mind. He observes that "people behave sometimes as if they had two selves, one who wants clean lungs and long life and another who adores tobacco, or one who wants a lean body and another who wants dessert, or one who yearns to improve himself by reading Adam Smith on self-commandand another who would rather watch an old movie on television. The two are in continual contest for control." When the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak, such as in pondering a diet-busting dessert, we can feel two very different kinds of motives fighting within us, one responding to sights and smells, the other to doctors advice. What about when the rewards are of the same kind, like a dollar today versus two dollars tomorrow? Perhaps an imminent reward engages a circuit for dealing with sure things and a distant one a circuit for betting on an uncertain future. One outranks the other, as if the whole person was designed to believe that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. In the modern environment, with its reliable knowledge of the future, that often leads to irrational choices. But our ancestors might have done well to distinguish between what is definitely enjoyable now and what is conjectured or rumored to be more enjoyable tomorrow.

When Jesus said "Suffer the little children to come unto me," he was saying that they should not go unto their parents. Successful religions and states eventually realize they have to coexist with families, but they do what they can to contain them, particularly the 440 I most threatening ones. The anthropologist Nancy Thornhill has found that the incest laws of most cultures are not created to deal with the problem of brother-sister marriages; brothers and sisters dont want to marry to begin with. Although brother-sister incest may be included in the prohibition and may help to legitimize it, the real targets of the laws are marrialges that threaten the interests of the lawmakers. The rules ban marriages among more distant relatives like cousins, and are promulgated by the rulers of stratified societies to prevent wealth and power from accumulating in families, which could be future rivals. The anthropologist Laura Betzig has shown that the medieval churchs rules on sex and marriage were also weapons against familial dynasties. In feudal Europe, parents did not bequeath their estates in equal parts to all of their children. Plots of land could not be subdivided every generation or they would become uselessly small, and a title can fall on only one heir. The custom of primogeniture arose, in which everything went to the oldest son and the other sons hit the road to seek their fortunes, often joining armies or the church. The church filled up with disinherited younger sons, who then manipulated marriage rules to make it harder for owners and title-holders to bear legitimate heirs. If they died without sons, the properties and titles passed back to the disinherited brothers or the church they served. According to their laws, a man could not divorce a childless wife, remarry while she was alive, adopt an heir, bear an heir with a woman closer than a seventh cousin, or have sex on various special days that added up to more than half the year. The story of Henry VIII reminds us that much of European history revolves around battles between powerful individuals trying to leverage family feelings for political gain marrying strategically, striving for heirs and other powerful individuals trying to foil them. PARENTS AND CHILDREN For an organism designed by natural selection, leaving descendants is the reason for being and the goal of all toil and struggle. The lave of a parent for a child should be vast, and so it is. But it should not be boundless. Robert Trivers discovered a subtle but profound implication of genetics for the psychology of the family. In most sexual species, parents bequeath fifty percent of their genes to each offspring. One strategy for maximizing the number of genes in Family Values 441 the next generation is to pump out as many babies as possible as quickly as possible. That is what most organisms do. Baby organisms, however, are more vulnerable than adults because they are smaller and less experienced, and in most species the majority never make it to adulthood. All organisms therefore face a "choice" of allocating their time, calories, and risk to caring for an existing offspring and upping its odds of survival, or cranking out new offspring and letting them all fend for themselves. Depending on details of the species ecosystem and body plan, either strategy can be genetically profitable. Birds and mammals have opted to care for their offspring, mammals by the extreme step of evolving organs that siphon nutrients from their own bodies and', 'and he that loveth '),

But any creature representing them as subclasses should at least tend to treat identical twins alike. The creature should transfer its opinions from one to the other, at least probabilistically or to some extent remember, that is a selling point of associationism and its implementation in connectoplasm. For example, whatever attracts you to one twin the way he walks, the way he talks, the way he looks, and so on should attract you to the other. And this Thinking Machines 117 should cast identical twins in tales of jealousy and betrayal of truly gothic proportions. In fact, nothing happens. The spouse of one identical twin feels no romantic attraction toward the other twin. Love locks our feelings in to another person as that person, not as a kind of person, no matter how narrow the kind. On March 10, 1988, someone bit off half the ear of Officer David J. Storton. No one doubts who did it: either Shawn Blick, a twenty-oneyear- old man living in Palo Alto, California, or Jonathan Blick, his identical twin brother. Both were scuffling with the officer, and one of them bit off part of his ear. Both were charged with mayhem, attempted burglary, assaulting a police officer, and aggravated mayhem. The aggravated mayhem charge, for the ear biting, carries a life sentence. Officer Storton testified that one of the twins had short hair and the other long, and it was the long-haired man who bit him. Unfortunately, by the time the men surrendered three days later they sported identical crew cuts and werent talking. Their lawyers argued that neither one could be given the severe sentence for aggravated mayhem. For each brother there is a reasonable doubt as to whether he did it, because it could have been the other. The argument is compelling because our sense of justice picks out the individual who did a deed, not the characteristics of that individual. Our obsession with individual personhood is not an inexplicable quirk, but probably evolved because every human being we meet, quite apart from any property we can observe, is guaranteed to house an unreplicable collection of memories and desires owing to a unique embryological and biographical history. In Chapter 6, when we reverseengineer the sense of justice and the emotion of romantic love, we will see that the mental act of registering individual persons is at the heart of their design. Human beings are not the only class of confusable individuals we have to keep distinct; a shell game is another real-life example. Many animals have to play shell games and thus keep track of individuals. One example is the mother who has to track her offspring, which may look like everyone elses but invisibly carries her genes. Another is the predator of herding animals, who has to track one member of the herd, following the tag-in-the-swimming-pool strategy: if youre "It," dont switch quarries, giving everyone but yourself time to catch their breath. When zoologists in Kenya tried to make their data collection easier by colorcoding the horns of wildebeests they had tranquilized, they found that no matter how carefully they restored the marked animal to vigor before 118 reintroducing it to the herd, it was killed within a day or so by hyenas. One explanation is that the colored marker made it easy for the hyenas to individuate the wildebeest and chase it to the point of exhaustion.

In effect, they have to do what the visual system does: given an image, figure out the arrangement of matter and lighting that could have brought it about. There are many ways the specialists ean satisfy you. Each could almost do it alone. The painter could simply paint the arrangement of parallelograms on a flat sheet of metal and ask the lighting designer to illuminate it with a single flood: The lighting designer could take a plain white sheet and set up nine custom spotlights, each with a special mask and filter, aimed just right lo project nine parallelograms onto the sheet (six of the spotlights are shown here): The sheet-metal worker could bend some metal into special shapes that when illuminated and viewed from just the right angle give rise to the image: The Minis Eye 251 Finally, the figure could be produced by the specialists cooperating. The painter would paint a stripe across the middle of a square sheet of metal, the sheet mem I worker would bend it into a zigzag, and the light inn designer would illuminate the piece with a floodlight. That, of course, is how a human being interprets the image. Our brain faces the same embarrassment of riches as the set designer in the parable. Once we allow in a mental "expert" that can hypothesize pigmented surfaces out there, it could explain everything in the image as paint: the world would be seen as a masterful trompe Ioeil. Likewise, a lighting expert in the head could tell us that the world is a movie. Since these interpretations are undesirable, the mental specialists should somehow be discouraged from making them. One way would be to force them to stick with their assumptions, come what may (color and lighting are even, shapes are regular and parallel), but thats too extreme. The world is not always a pile of blocks on a sunny day; sometimes it does have complicated pigments and lighting, and we see them. We dont want the experts to deny that the world can be complex. We want them to propose exactly as much complexity as there is in the world, and no more. The problem now is how to get them all to do it. Return now to the parable.

I will never forget the time a !Kung man the father of a family, about forty years of age, well respected in the community, a good and substantial man in every way asked me to hold on to a leg of antelope he had killed. He had given away most of it, as one had to. But he saw a chance to hide some of it, for later, for himself and his own family.

But in most mammals the cards are stacked against doting fatherhood. The egg is tucked away inside the mother, where some other male can fertilize it, so a male is never certain an offspring is his. He faces the danger of wasting his investment on another males genes. Also, the embryo does most of its growing inside the mother, where the father cant get at it to help directly. And a father can easily desert and try to mate with another female, whereas the female is left holding the bag and cannot get rid of the fetus or offspring without having to go through the long process of nurturing an embryo all over again to get back to where she started. Fatherhood is also promoted when a species lifestyle makes the benefits exceed the costs: when the offspring would be vulnerable without him, when he can easily provision them with concentrated food like meat, and when the young are easy to defend. When males become devoted fathers, the rules of the mating game change. A female may choose a mate based on his ability and his willingness to invest in their offspring, insofar as she can judge. Females, not just males, compete for mates, though the prizes are different: males compete for fertile females willing to copulate, females compete for flush males willing to invest. Polygamy is no longer a matter of one male beating up all the others, or the females all wanting to be inseminated by the fiercest or prettiest male. When males invest more than females, as we have seen, the species may be polyandrous, with tough females keeping harems of males. (The mammals body plan has foreclosed that option.) When one male has much more to invest than others (because, say, he controls a better territory), females may be better off sharing him polygyny than each having her own mate, because a fraction of a big resource may be better than the entirety of a small one. When males Family Values 467 contributions are more equal, the undivided attention of one becomes valuable, and the species settles on monogamy. Many birds appear to be monogamous. In Manhattan, Woody Allen says to Diane Keaton, "I think people should mate for life, like pigeons or Catholics." The movie came out before ornithologists began to submit birds to DNA testing, which revealed, to their shock, that pigeons are not so faithful either. In some species of birds, a third of the offspring contain the DNA of a male other than the females consort. The male bird is adulterous because he tries to raise the offspring of one female and mate with others, hoping that her offspring will survive on their own, or best of all, be raised', 'are four times smaller '),

A colleague tells me that there is a ninety-five percent chance he will show up at my talk. He doesnt come. Was he lying? You may be thinking: granted, a single-event probability is just subjective confidence, but isnt it rational to calibrate confidence by relative frequency? If everyday people dont do it that way, wouldnt they be irrational? Ah, but the relative frequency of what? To count frequencies you have to decide on a class of events to count up, and a single event belongs to an infinite number of classes. Richard von Mises, a pioneer of probability theory, gives an example. In a sample of American women between the ages of 35 and 50, 4 out of 100 develop breast cancer within a year. Does Mrs. Smith, a 49-yearold American woman, therefore have a 4% chance of getting breast cancer in the next year? There is no answer. Suppose that in a sample of women between the ages of 45 and 90 a class to which Mrs. Smith also belongs 11 out of 100 develop breast cancer in a year. Are Mrs. Smiths chances 4%, or are they 11%? Suppose that her mother had breast cancer, and 22 out of 100 women between 45 and 90 whose mothers had the disease will develop it. Are her chances 4%, 11%, or 22%? She also smokes, lives in California, had two children before the age of 25 and one after 40, is of Greek descentWhat group should we compare her with to figure out the "true" odds? You might think, the more specific the class, the better but the more specific the class, the smaller its size and the less reliable the frequency. If there were only two people in the world very much like Mrs. Smith, and one developed breast cancer, would anyone say that Mrs. Smiths chances are 50%? In the limit, the only class that is truly comparable with Mrs. Smith in all her details is the class containing Mrs. Smith herself. But in a class of one, "relative frequency" makes no sense. These philosophical questions about the meaning of probability are not academic; they affect every decision we make. When a smoker rationalizes that his ninety-year-old parents have been puffing a pack a day for decades, so the nationwide odds dont apply to him, he might very well be right. In the 1996 presidential election, the advanced age of the Republican candidate became an issue. The New Republic published the following letter: 350 To the Editors: In your editorial "Is Dole Too Old?" (April 1) your actuarial information was misleading. The average 72-year-old white man may suffer a 27 percent risk of dying within five years, but more than health and gender must be considered. Those still in the work force, as is Senator Bob Dole, have a much greater longevity. In addition, statistics show that greater wealth correlates to a longer life. Taking these characteristics into consideration, the average 73-year-old (the age that Dole would be if he takes office as president) has a 12.7 percent chance of dying within four years. Yes, and what about the average seventy-three-year-old wealthy working white male who hails from Kansas, doesnt smoke, and was strong enough to survive an artillery shell? An even more dramatic difference surfaced during the murder trial of O.J. Simpson in 1995.

A simple example is the Victorian novelty in which a peephole in a door revealed a sumptuously furnished room, but when the door was opened the room was empty. The sumptuous room was in a dollhouse nailed to the door over the peephole. The painter-turned-psychologist Adelbert Ames, Jr., made a career out of carpentering even stranger illusory rooms. In one, rods and slabs were suspended from wires higgledy-piggledy throughout the room. But when the room was seen from outside through a peephole in a wall, the rods and slabs lined up into a projection of a kitchen chair. In another 216 room, the rear wall slanted away from left to right, but it had crajzy angles that made its left side just short enough to cancel its expansion in perspective, and its right side just tall enough to cancel its contraction. Through a peephole on the opposite side, the wall projected a rectangle. The visual system hates coincidences: it assumes that a regular image comes from something that really is regular and that it doesnt just look that way because of the fortuitous alignment of an irregular shape. Ames did align an irregular shape to give a regular image, and he reinforced his cunning trick with crooked windows and floor tiles. When a child stands in the near corner and her mother stands in the far one, the child projects a larger retinal image. The brain takes depth into account when assessing size; thats why a looming toddler never seems to dominate her distant parent in everyday life. But now the viewers sense of depth is a victim of its distaste for coincidence. Every inch of the wall appears the same distance away, so the retinal images of the bodies are interpreted at face value, and Junior towers over Mom. When they change places by walking along the rear wall, Junior shrinks to lapdog size and Mom becomes Wilt Chamberlain. Ames room has been built in several museums of science, such as the Exploratorium in San Francisco, and you can see (or be seen in) this astonishing illusion for yourself. Now, a picture is nothing but a more convenient way of arranging matter so that it projects a pattern identical to real objects. The mimicking matter sits on a flat surface, rather than in a dollhouse or suspended by wires, and it is formed by smearing pigments rather than by cutting shapes out of wood. The shapes of the smears can be determined without the twisted ingenuity of an Ames. The trick was stated succinctly by Leonardo da Vinci: "Perspective is nothing else than seeing a place behind a pane of glass, quite transparent, on the surface of which the objects behind the glass are drawn." If the painter sights the scene from The Minds Eye 217 a fixed viewing position and copies the contours faithfully, down to the last hair of the dog, a person who then views the painting from the position of the painter would have his eye impaled by the same sheaf of light rays that the original scene projected. In that part of the visual field the painting and the world would be indistinguishable. Whatever assumptions impel the brain to see the world as the world and not as smeared pigment will impel it to see the painting as the world and not as smeared pigment. What are those assumptions?

When one of these units turns on, the network is guessing that there is a splotch at a particular depth in the world (relative to where the eyes have converged). Here is a birds-eye view of one plane of the network, showing a fraction of the units. Array of processors, one for each matchup The model works as follows. A unit turns on only if it gets the same inputs from the two eyes (black or white), embodying the first assumption (each mark anchored to a surface). Because the units are interconnected, the activation of one unit nudges the activations of its neighbors up or down. Units for different matches lying along the same line of sight inhibit one another, embodying the second assumption (no coincidental markings aligned along a line of sight). Units for neighboring points at nearby depths excite one another, emhodying the third assumption (matter is cohesive). The activations reverberate around the network, and it eventually stabilizes, with the activated units tracing out a contour in depth. In the diagram, the filled-in units are showing an edge hovering over its background, The constraint-satisfaction technique, in which thousands of processors make tentative guesses and hash it out among themselves until a global solution emerges, is consistent with the general idea that the brain works with lots of interconnected processors computing in parallel. It captures some of the psychology, too. When viewing a complicated random- dot stereogram, often you dont see the hidden figure erupt instantaneously. A bit of edge might pop out from the pepper, which then lifts up a sheet, which cleans and straightens a Fuzzy border on the other side, and so on until the whole shape coalesces. We experience the solution emerging, but not the struggle of the processors to come up with it. The experience is a good reminder that as we see and think, dozens of iterations of information processing go on beneath the level of consciousness. The Marr-Poggio model captures the flavor of the brains computation of stereo vision, but our real circuitry is surely more sophisticated. Experiments have shown that when people are put in artificial worlds that violate assumptions about uniqueness and smoothness, they dont see as badly as the model predicts. The brain must be using additional kinds of information to help solve the matchup problem, for one thing, the world is not made up of random dots. The brain can match up all the little diagonals, Ts, zigzags, inkblots, and other jots and tittles in the two eyes views (which even a random-dot stereogram has in abundance). There are far fewer false matches among jots and tittles than there are among dots, so the number of matches that have to be ruled out is radically shaved. Another matchmaking trick is to exploit a different geometric consequence of having two eyes, the one noticed by Leonardo: there are parts of an object that one eye can see but that the other eye cannot. Hold a The Minds Eye 237 pen vertically in front of you, with the clip facing away at eleven oclock. When you close each eye in turn, you will notice that only the left eye can see the clip; it is hidden from the right eye by the rest of the pen.

(212, 36, 3, 'as another source of information about depth, perhaps an indispensable one. Stereo vision gives information only about relative depth depth in front of or behind the point on which the eyes have converged and feedback from eyeball direction must be used to anchor a sense of absolute depth. Now heres the problem for the stereoscope designer. The focusing reflex and the eye-crossing reflex are coupled. If you focus on a nearby point to eliminate blur, the eyes converge; if you focus on a distant one, they become parallel. If you converge your eyes on a nearby point to eliminate double vision, the eyes squeeze the lens to close-up focus; if you diverge your eyes on a distant point, they relax for distant focus. The coupling defeats the most straightforward design for a stereoscope, in which a small picture is placed in front of each eye and both eyes point straight ahead, each at its own picture. Pointing the eyes straight ahead is what you do for distant objects, and it drags the focus of each eye to distance vision, blurring the pictures. Focusing the pictures then brings the eyes together, so the eyes are pointing at the same picture rather than each eye aiming at a different one, and thats no good, either. The eyes bob in and out and the lenses thicken and flatten, but not at the right times. To get a stereoscopic illusion, something has to give. One solution is to uncouple the responses. Many experimental psychologists have trained themselves like fakirs to wrest control of their reflexes and to "free-fuse" stereograms by an act of will. Some cross their eyes at an imaginary point in front of the picture, so that the left eye is staring at the right picture and vice versa, while they focus each eye on the picture behind the imaginary point. Others lock their eyes straight ahead to infinity while maintaining focus. I once took an afternoon out to train myself to do this after I learned that William James said it was a skill every good psychologist should master. But people with lives cannot be expected to show such dedication. Wheatstones invention was a bit ungainly because he faced a second problem: the drawings and daguerreotypes of his age were too big to fit The Minds Eye 223 in front of the eyes without overlapping, and people could not point their eyes outward to gaze at one on each side like fish. So he put one picture off to each side, the two facing each other like bookends, and between them he placed two mirrors glued together like the cover of an open book, each mirror reflecting a picture. He then put a prism in front of each mirror and adjusted them so that the two mirrors appeared to be superimposed. When people looked through the prisms and saw the superimposed reflections of the two pictures, the^ scene in the pictures leapt into three-dimensionality. The advent of better cameras and smaller film led to a simpler, hand-held design that is still with us. Small pictures as always, photographed from two vantage points positioned like the eyes are placed side by side with a perpendicular blinker between them and a glass lens in front of each eye. The glass lens relieves the eye of having to focus its nearby picture, and the eye can relax to its infinity setting. That spreads the eyes so they are pointing straight ahead, one at each picture, and the pictures easily fuse. The stereoscope became the television of the nineteenth century.

People in all cultures carry out long chains of reasoning built from links whose truth they could not have observed directly. Philosophers have often pointed out that science is made possible by that ability. Like many issues surrounding the mind, the debate over connectionism is often cast as a debate between innateness and learning. And as always, 130 I that makes it impossible to think clearly. Certainly learning plays an enormous role in connectionist modeling. Often a modeler, sent back to the drawing board by the problems I have mentioned, will take advantage of a hidden-layer networks ability to learn a set of inputs and outputs and generalize them to new, similar ones. By training the living daylights out of a generic hidden-layer network, one can sometimes get it to do approximately the right thing. But heroic training regimes cannot, by themselves, be the salvation of connectoplasm. That is not because the networks have too little innate structure and too much environmental input. It is because raw connectoplasm is so underpowered that networks must often be built with the worst combination: too much innate structure combined with too much environmental input. For example, Hinton devised a three-layer network to compute family relationships. (He intended it as a demonstration of how networks work, but other connectionists have treated it as a real theory of psychology.) The input layer had units for a name and units for a relationship, such as "Colin" and "mother." The output layer had units for the name of the person so related, such as "Victoria." Since the units and connections are the innate structure of a network, and only the connection weights are learned, taken literally the network corresponds to an innate module in the brain just for spitting out answers to questions about who is related to a named person in a given way. It is not a system for reasoning about kinship in general, because the knowledge is smeared across the connection weights linking the question layer to the answer layer, rather than being stored in a database that can be accessed by different retrieval processes. So the knowledge is useless if the question is changed slightly, such as asking how two people are related or asking for the names and relationships in a persons family. In this sense, the model has too much innate structure; it is tailored to a specific quiz. After training the model to reproduce the relationships in a small, made-up family, Hinton called attention to its ability to generalize to new pairs of kin. But in the fine print we learn that the network had to be trained on 100 of the 104 possible pairs in order to generalize to the remaining 4. And each of the 100 pairs in the training regime had to be fed into the network 1,500 times (150,000 lessons in all)! Obviously children do not learn family relationships in a manner even remotely like this. The numbers are typical of connectionist networks, because they do not cut to the solution by means of rules but need to have most of the examples pounded into them and merely interpolate between the examThinking Machines 131 pies.

(214, 38, 3, 'at which the object is not dead-center, or the different viewing distances). One cannot skimp by specifying a few views, like an architects plan and elevation, because in principle any of the views might be crucial. (Simple proof: Imagine a shape consisting of a hollow sphere with a toy glued on the inside and a small hole drilled opposite it. Only by sighting the toy exactly through the hole can the entire shape be seen.) But recently the idea has made a comeback. By choosing views judiciously, and using a pattern-associator neural network to interpolate between them when an The Minds Eye 275 object doesnt match a view spot-on, one can get away with storing a manageable number of views per object, forty at most. It still seems unlikely that people have to see an object from forty different angles to recognize it thereafter, but another trick is available. Remember that people rely on the up-down direction to construe shapes: squares arent diamonds, sideways Africa goes unrecognized. This introduces another contamination of the pure geon theory: relations like "above" and "top" must come from the retina (with some adjustment from gravity), not from the object. That concession may be inevitable, because theres often no way of pinpointing the "top" of an object before youve recognized it. But the real problem comes from what people do with sideways objects they dont recognize at first. If you tell people that a shape has been turned sideways, they recognize it quickly, as you surely did when I told you that the Africa drawing was on its side. People can mentally rotate a shape to the upright and then recognize the rotated image. With a mental image-rotator available, the object-centered frame of the geon theory becomes even less necessary. People could store some 272-D views from a few standard vantage points, like police mug shots, and if an object in front of them didnt match one of the shots, they would mentally rotate it until it did. Some combination of multiple views and a mental rotator would make geon models in object-centered reference frames unnecessary. With all these options for shape recognition, how can we tell what the mind actually does? The only way is to study real human beings recognizing shapes in the laboratory. One famous set of experiments pointed to mental rotation as a key. The psychologists Lynn Cooper and Roger Shepard showed people letters of the alphabet at different orientations upright, tilted 45 degrees, sideways, tilted 135 degrees, and upside down. Cooper and Shepard didnt have people blurt out the letters name because they were worried about shortcuts: a distinctive squiggle like a loop or a tail might be detectable in any orientation and give away the answer. So they forced their subjects to analyze the full geometry of each letter by showing either the letter or its mirror image, and having the subjects press one button if the letter was normal and the other if it was mirror-reversed. 276 When Cooper and Shepard measured how long it took people to press the button, they observed a clear signature of mental rotation. The farther the letter was misoriented from the upright, the longer people took. Thats exactly what you would expect if people gradually dialed an image of the letter to the upright; the more it has to be turned, the longer the turning takes. Maybe, then, people recognize shapes by turning them over in their minds. But maybe not. People were not just recognizing shapes; they were discriminating them from their mirror images. Mirror images are special. It', 'at which the object '),

According to legend, the diva Maria Callas stipulated that any opera house she sang in had to pay her one dollar more than the next highest paid singer in the company.

Yet we dont spend our lives walking on air, and presumably Hotheads 391 our ancestors were not chronically glum. It is not reactionary to point out that many of the poor in todays Western nations live in conditions that yesterdays aristocrats could not have dreamed of. People in different classes and countries are often content with their lot until they compare themselves to the more affluent. The amount of violence in a society is more closely related to its inequality than to its poverty. In the second half of the twentieth century, the discontent of the Third World, and later the Second, have been attributed to their glimpses through the mass media of the First. The other major clue to the attainable is how well off you are now. What you have now is attainable, by definition, and chances are you can do at least a little bit better. Evolutionary theory predicts that a mans reach should exceed his grasp, but not by much. Here we have the second tragedy of happiness: people adapt to their circumstances, good or bad, the way their eyes adapt to sun or darkness. From that neutral point, improvement is happiness, loss is misery. Again, the sages said it first. The narrator of E. A. Robinsons poem (and later Simon and Garfunkels song) envies the factory owner, Richard Cory, who "glittered when he walked." So on we worked, and waited for the light, And went without the meat, and cursed the bread; And Richard Cory, one calm summer night, Went home and put a bullet through his head. The futility of striving has led many dark souls to deny that happiness is possible.

Freud said that the goal of psychotherapy was "to transform hysterical misery into common unhappiness." A colleague, consulting with me by email about a troubled graduate student, wrote, "sometimes i wish i was young then i remember that wasnt so great either."

According to the geon theory, orientation shouldnt matter at all. People would learn the objects by mentally describing the various arms and crosses in a coordinate system centered on the object. Then, when a test shape flashed on the screen, it should make no difference if it was sideways, tilted, or upside down. Overlaying a frame should be quick and foolproof, and the shapes description relative to the frame would match the memory model every time. The envelope, please. And the winner isAll of the above. People definitely stored several views: when a shape appeared in one of its habitual orientations, people were very quick to identify it. And people definitely rotate shapes in their minds. When a shape appeared at a new, unfamiliar orientation, the farther it would have to be rotated to be aligned with the nearest familiar view, the more time people took. And at least for some shapes, people use an object-centered reference frame, as in the geon theory. Tarr and I ran a variant of the experiment in which the shapes had simpler geometries: The Minds Eye 281 D H D K h 3 The shapes were symmetrical or nearly symmetrical, or always had the same kinds of frills on each side, so people would never have to describe the parts up-down and side-to-side arrangements in the same reference frame. With these shapes, people were uniformly quick at identifying them in all their orientations; upside down was no slower than right-side up. So people use all the tricks. If a shapes sides are not too different, they store it as a 3-D geon model centered on the objects own axes. If the shape is more complicated, they store a copy of what it looks like at each orientation they see it in. When the shape appears at an unfamiliar orientation, they mentally rotate it into the nearest familiar one. Perhaps we shouldnt be surprised. Shape recognition is such a hard problem that a single, general-purpose algorithm may not work for every shape under every viewing condition. Let me finish the story with my happiest moment as an experimenter. You may be skeptical about the mental turntable. All we know is that tilted shapes are recognized more slowly. Ive glibly written that people rotate an image, but maybe tilted shapes are just harder to analyze for other reasons. Is there any evidence that people actually simulate a physical rotation in real time, degree by degree? Does their behavior show some signature of the geometry of rotation that could convince us that they play a movie in their minds? Tarr and I had been baffled by one of our findings. In a different experiment, we had tested people both on the shapes they had studied and on their mirror images, at a variety of orientations: What people were taught Standard: ©*" Mirror: 282 It wasnt a mirror-image test, like the Cooper and Shepard experiments; people were told to treat the two versions the same, just as they use the same word for a left and a right glove.

For the standard versions (top row), people took longer when the shape was tilted farther: every picture in the top row took a bit longer than the one before.

(217, 41, 3, 'because the network does not care that the connections belong to an animal at all. The connections merely say which visible properties predict which invisible properties, skipping ideas about species of animals altogether. Conceptually speaking, a pattern associator captures the idea that if two objects are similar in some ways, they are probably similar in other ways. Mechanically speaking, similar objects are represented by some of the very same units, so any piece of information connected to the units for one object will ipso facto be connected to many of the units for the other. Moreover, classes of different degrees of inclusiveness are superimposed in the same network, because any subset of the units implicitly defines a class. The fewer the units, the larger the class. Say there are input units for "moves," "breathes," "hairy," "barks," "bites," and "lifts-legat- hydrants." The connections emanating out of all six trigger facts about dogs. The connections emanating out of the first three trigger facts about mammals. The connections emanating out of the first two trigger facts about animals. With suitable weights, the knowledge programmed in for one animal can be shared with both its immediate and its distant family members. A fifth trick of neural networks is that they learn from examples, where learning consists of changes in the connection weights. The model-builder (or evolution) does not have to hand-set the thousands of weights needed to get the outputs right. Suppose a "teacher" feeds a pattern associator with an input and also with the correct output. A learning mechanism compares the networks actual output which at first will be pretty random with the correct one, and adjusts the weights to minimize the difference between the two. If the network leaves an output node off that the teacher says ought to be on, we want to make it more likely that the current funnel of active inputs will turn it on in the future. So the weights on the active inputs to the recalcitrant output unit are increased slightly. In addition, the output nodes own threshold is lowered slightly, to make it more trigger-happy across the board. If the network turns an output node on and the teacher says it should be off, the opposite happens: the weights of the currently active input lines are taken down a notch (possibly driving the weight past zero to a negative value), and the target nodes threshold is raised. This all makes the hyperactive output node more likely to turn off in response to those Thinking Machines 109 inputs in the future. A whole series of inputs and their outputs is presented to the network, over and over, causing waves of little adjustments of the connection weights, until it gets every output right for every input, at least as well as it can manage to. A pattern associator equipped with this learning technique is called a perceptron. Perceptrons are interesting but have a big flaw. They are like the chef from hell: they think that if a little of each ingredient is good, a lot of everything must be better. In deciding whether a set of inputs justifies turning on an output, the perceptron weights them and adds them up. Often that gives the wrong answer, even on very simple problems. A textbook example of this flaw is the perceptrons handling of the simple logical operation called exclusive-or ("xor"), which means "A or B, but not both." When A is on, the network should turn A-xor-B on. When B is on, the network should turn A-xor-B on.

Disgust is intuitive microbiology. Why are insects and other small creatures like worms and toads what Latin Americans call "animalitos" so easy to revile? The anthropologist Marvin Harris has shown that cultures avoid animalitos when larger animals are available, and eat them when they are not. The explanation has nothing to do with sanitation, since bugs are safer than meat. It comes from optimal foraging theory, the analysis of how animals ought to and usually do allocate their time to maximize the rate of nutrients they consume. Animalitos are small and dispersed, and it takes a lot of catching and preparing to get a pound of protein. A large mammal is hundreds of pounds of meat on the hoof, available all at once. (In 1978 a rumor circulated that McDonalds was extending the meat in Big Macs with earthworms. But if the corporation were as avaricious as the rumor was meant to imply, the rumor could not be true: worm meat is far more expensive than beef.) In most environments it is not only more efficient to eat larger animals, but the small ones should be avoided altogether the time to gather them would be better spent hunting for a bigger payoff. Animalitos are thus absent from the diets of cultures that have bigger fish to fry, and since, in the minds of eaters, whatever is not permitted is forbidden, those cultures find them disgusting.

For thousands of years, rabbis have offered ingenious justifications of the Jewish dietary laws. Here are a few listed in the Encyclopedia Judaica: 384 J From Aristeas, first century BC: "The dietary laws are ethical in intent, since abstention from the consumption of blood tames mans instinct for violence by instilling in him a horror of bloodshed.The injunction against the consumption of birds of prey was intended to demonstrate that man should not prey on others." From Isaac ben Moses Arama: "The reason behind all the dietary prohibitions is not that any harm may be caused to the body, but that these foods defile and pollute the soul and blunt the intellectual powers, thus leading to confused opinions and a lust for perverse and brutish appetites which lead men to destruction, thus defeating the purpose of creation." From Maimonides: "All the food which the Torah has forbidden us to eat have some bad and damaging effect on the body.The principal reason why the Law forbids swines flesh is to be found in the circumstances that its habits and its food are very dirty and loathsome.The fat of the intestines is forbidden because it fattens and destroys the abdomen and creates cold and clammy blood.Meat boiled in milk is undoubtedly gross food, and makes a person feel overfull." From Abraham ibn Ezra: "I believe it is a matter of cruelty to cook a kid in its mothers milk." From Nahmanides: "Now the reason for specifying fins and scales is that fish which have fins and scales get nearer to the surface of the water and are found more generally in freshwater areas.Those without fins and scales usually live in the lower muddy strata which are exceedingly moist and where there', 'because they reproduce A '),
(219, 43, 3, 'bewilderment of intellectual vertigo McGinn shows how thinkers have cycled among four kinds of solutions over the ages, none satisfactory. Philosophical problems have a feeling of the divine, and the favorite 560 J solution in most times and places is mysticism and religion. Consciousness is a divine spark in each of us. The self is the soul, an immaterial ghost that floats above physical events. Souls just exist, or they were created by God. God granted each soul a moral worth and the power of choice. He has stipulated what is good, and inscribes every souls good and evil acts in the book of life and rewards or punishes it after it leaves the body. Knowledge is granted by God to the prophet or the seer, or guaranteed to all of us by Gods honesty and omniscience. The solution is explained in the rejoinder to the limerick (p. 316) about why the tree continues to be when theres no one about in the quad: Dear Sir, Your astonishments odd: J am always about in the quad. And thats why the tree will continue to be, Since observed by Yours Faithfully, God. The problem with the religious solution was stated by Mencken when he wrote, "Theology is the effort to explain the unknowable in terms of the not worth knowing." For anyone with a persistent intellectual curiosity, religious explanations are not worth knowing because they pile equally baffling enigmas on top of the original ones. What gave God a mind, free will, knowledge, certainty about right and wrong? How does he infuse them into a universe that seems to run just fine according to physical laws? How does he get ghostly souls to interact with hard matter? And most perplexing of all, if the world unfolds according to a wise and merciful plan, why does it contain so much suffering? As the Yiddish expression says, If God lived on earth, people would break his windows. Modern philosophers have tried three other solutions. One is to say that the mysterious entities are an irreducible part of the universe and to leave it at that. The universe, we would conclude, contains space, time, gravity, electromagnetism, nuclear forces, matter, energy, and consciousness (or will, or selves, or ethics, or meaning, or all of them). The answer to our curiosity about why the universe has consciousness is, "Get over it, it just does." We feel cheated because no insight has been offered, and because we know that the details of consciousness, will, and knowledge are minutely related to the physiology of the brain. The irreducibility theory leaves that a coincidence. A second approach is to deny that there is a problem. We have been The Meaning of Life 561 misled by fuzzy thinking or by beguiling but empty idioms of language, such as the pronoun J. Statements about consciousness, will, self, and ethics cannot be verified by mathematical proof or empirical test, so they are meaningless. But this answer leaves us incredulous, not enlightened. As Descartes observed, our own consciousness is the most indubitable thing there is. It is a datum to be explained; it cannot be defined out of existence by regulations about what we are allowed to call meaningful (to say nothing of ethical statements, such as that slavery and the Holocaust were wrong). A third approach is to domesticate the problem by collapsing it with one we can solve. Consciousness is activity in layer 4 of the cortex, or the contents of short-term memory. Free will is in the anterior cingulate sulcus or the executive subroutine. Morality is kin selection and reciprocal', 'bewilderment of intellectual vertigo '),
(220, 44, 3, 'both green and an and the letter sits somewhere in a mixed sea of green Xs and red Os, the person must consciously search the display, letter by letter, checking each one to see if it meets the two-part criterion. The task becomes like the childrens comic strip Wheres Waldo?, in which the hero in the red-andwhite- striped jersey hides in a throng of people -wearing red, white, or stripes. What exactly is happening? Imagine that the visual field is sprinkled with thousands of little processors, each of which detects a color or a simple shape like a curve, an angle, or a line whenever it appears at the processors location. The output of one set of processors looks like this: red red red red green red red red, and so on. The output of another set looks like this: straight straight straight curved straight straight straight, and so on. Superimposed on these processors is a layer of odd-man-out detectors. Each stands astride a group of line or color detectors and "marks" any spot on the visual field that differs from its neighbors in color or in contour. The green surrounded by reds acquires a little extra flag. All it takes to see a green among reds is to spot the flag, a task within the powers of even the simplest demon. An O among Xs can be detected in the same way. But the thousands of processors tiled across the field are too stupid to calculate conjunctions of features: a patch that is green and curved, or red and straight. The conjunctions are detected only by a programmable logic machine that looks at one part of the visual field at a time through a narrow, movable window, and passes on its answer to the rest of cognition. Why is visual computation divided into an unconscious parallel stage and a conscious serial stage? Conjunctions are combinatorial. It would be impossible to sprinkle conjunction detectors at every location in the visual field because there are too many kinds of conjunctions. There are a million visual locations, so the number of processors needed would be a million multiplied by the number of logically possible conjunctions: the number of colors we can discriminate times the number of contours times the number of depths times the number of directions of motion times the number of velocities, and so on, an astronomical number. Parallel, unconscious computation stops after it labels each location with a color, contour, depth, and motion; the combinations then have to be computed, consciously, at one location at a time. The theory makes a surprising prediction. If the conscious processor is focused at one location, the features at other locations should float 142 around unglued. For example, a person not deliberately attending to a region should not know whether it contains a red X and a green O or a green X and a red O the color and shape should float in separate planes until the conscious processor binds them together at a particular spot. Treisman found that that is what happens. When people are distracted from some colored letters, they can report the letters and they can report the colors, but they misreport which color went with which letter. These illusory combinations are a striking demonstration of the limits of unconscious visual computation, and they are not uncommon in everyday life. When words are glimpsed absent-mindedly or out of the corner of the eye, the letters sometimes rearrange themselves. One psychologist began to study the phenomenon after he walked past a coffee machine and wondered why it claimed to be', 'both green and an '),
(221, 45, 3, 'But as far as a geometer is concerned, they are one and the same shape. They are pegs that fit the same holes; every angle and line is the same. The only difference is in how they are aligned with respect to the viewers up-and-down reference frame, and that difference is enough to earn them different words in the English language. A square is flat on top, a diamond is pointy on top; theres no avoiding the "on top." It is even hard to see that the diamond is made of right angles. Finally, objects themselves can plot out reference frames: The Minds Eye 267 The shape at the top right flips between looking like a square and looking like a diamond, depending on whether you mentally group it with the three shapes to its left or the eight shapes below. The imaginary lines aligned with the rows of shapes have become Cartesian reference frames one frame aligned with the retinal up-down, the other tilted diagonally -and a shape looks different when it is mentally described within one or the other. And in case you are still skeptical about all these colorless, odorless, and tasteless reference frames allegedly overlaying the visual field, I give you a wonderfully simple demonstration from the psychologist Fred Attneave. What is going on in the triangles on the left:1 Look at them long enough, and they snap from one appearance to another. They dont move around, they dont reverse in depth, but something changes. People describe the change as "which way they point." What is leaping around the page is not the triangles themselves but a mental frame of reference overlaying the triangles. The frame comes not from the retina, the head, the body, the room, the page, or gravity, but from an axis of symmetry of the triangles. The triangles have three such axes, and they take turns dominating. Each axis has the equivalent of a north and a south pole, which grant the feeling that the triangles are pointing. The triangles flip en masse, as if in a chorus line; the brain likes its reference frames to embrace entire neighborhoods of shapes. The triangles in the right diagram are even more jumpy, hopping among six impressions. They can be interpreted either as obtuse triangles lying flat on the page or as right-angle triangles standing in depth, each with a reference frame that can sit three ways. 268 ANIMAL CRACKERS The ability of objects to attract reference frames to themselves helps to solve one of the great problems in vision, the next problem we face as we continue our climb from the retina to abstract thought. How do people recognize shapes? An average adult knows names for about ten thousand things, most of them distinguished by shape. Even a six-year-old knows names for a few thousand, having learned them at a rate of one every few hours for years. Of course, objects can be recognized from many giveaways. Some can be recognized by their sounds and smells, and others, such as shirts in a hamper, can be identified only by their color and material. But most objects can be recognized by their shapes. When we recognize an objects shape, we are acting as pure geometers, surveying the distribution of matter in space and finding the closest match in memory. The mental geometer must be acute indeed, for a three-year-old can look through a box of animal crackers or a pile of garish plastic chips and rattle off the names of exotic fauna from their silhouettes. The diagram at the bottom of page 9 introduced you to', 'But as far as '),
(222, 46, 3, 'But neither animals nor facial expressions were as hard for him as faces, which drew utter blanks. Its not that faces are the hardest things our brains are ever called upon to recognize, so that if a brain is not running on all eight cylinders, face recognition will be the first thing to suffer. The psychologists Marlene Behrmann, Morris Moscbvitch, and Gordon Winocur studied a young man who had been hit on the head by the rear-view mirror of a passing truck. He has trouble recognizing everyday objects but no trouble recognizing faces, even when the faces are disguised with glasses, wigs, or mustaches. His syndrome is the opposite of prosopagnosia, and it proves that face recognition is different from object recognition, not just harder. So do prosopagnosics have a broken face-recognition module? Some psychologists, noting that LH and other prosopagnosics have some trouble with some other shapes, would rather say that prosopagnosics have trouble processing the kinds of geometric features that are most useful in recognizing faces, though also useful in recognizing certain other kinds of shapes. I think the distinction between recognizing faces and recognizing objects with the geometry of faces is meaningless. From the brains point of view, nothing is a face until it has been recognized as a face. The only thing that can be special about a perception module is the kind of geometry it pays attention to, such as the distance between symmetrical blobs, or the curvature pattern of 2-D elastic surfaces that are drawn over a 3-D skeleton and filled out by underlying soft pads and connectors. If objects other than faces (animals, facial expressions, or 274 J even cars) have some of these geometric features, the module will have no choice but to analyze them, even if they are most useful for faces. To call a module a face-recognizer is not to say it can handle only faces; it is to say that it is optimized for the geometric features that distinguish faces because the organism was selected in its evolutionary history for an ability to recognize them. T h e geon theory is lovely, but is it true? Certainly not in its purest form, in which every object would get one description of its 3-D geometry, uncontaminated by the vagaries of vantage point. Most objects are opaque, with some surfaces obscuring others. That makes it literally impossible to arrive at the same description of the object from every vantage point. For example, you cant know what the back of a house looks like when you are standing in front of it. Marr got around the problem by ignoring surfaces altogether and analyzing animals shapes as if they were built out of pipe cleaners. Biedermans version concedes the problem and gives each object several geon models in the mental shape catalogue, one for each view required to reveal all its surfaces. But this concession opens the door to a completely different way of doing shape recognition. Why not go all the way and give each shape a large number of memory files, one for every vantage point? Then the files wouldnt need a fancy object-centered reference frame; they could use the retinal coordinates available free in the 2lh-D sketch, as long as there were enough files to cover all the angles of view. For many years this idea was dismissed out of hand. If the continuum of viewing angles were chopped into one-degree differences, one would need forty thousand files for every object to cover them all (and those are just to cover the viewing angles; they dont embrace the viewing', 'But neither animals nor '),
(223, 47, 3, 'But people do not use imagery just to rearrange the furniture or dig up armadillos. The eminent psychologist D. O. Hebb once wrote, "You can hardly turn around in psychology without bumping into the image." Give people a list of nouns to memorize, and they will imagine them interacting in bizarre images. Give them factual questions like "Does a flea have a mouth?" and they will visualize the flea and "look for" the mouth. And, of course, give them a complex shape at an unfamiliar orientation, and they will rotate its image to a familiar one. Many creative people claim to "see" the solution to a problem in an image. Faraday and Maxwell visualized electromagnetic fields as tiny tubes filled with fluid. Kekule saw the benzene ring in a reverie of snakes biting their tails. Watson and Crick mentally rotated models of what was to become the double helix. Einstein imagined what it would be like to ride on a beam of light or drop a penny in a plummeting elevator. He once wrote, "My particular ability does not lie in mathematical calculation, but rather in visualizing effects, possibilities, and consequences." Painters and sculptors try out ideas in their minds, and even novelists visualize scenes and plots in their minds eye before putting pen to paper. Images drive the emotions as well as the intellect. Hemingway wrote, "Cowardice, as distinguished from panic, is almost always simply a lack of ability to suspend the functioning of the imagination." Ambition, anxiety, sexual arousal, and jealous rage can all be triggered by images of what isnt there. In one experiment, volunteers were hooked up to electrodes and asked to imagine their mates being unfaithful. The authors report, "Their skin conductance increased 1.5 microSiemens, the corrugator muscle in their brow showed 7.75 microvolts units of contraction, and their heart rates accelerated by five beats per minute, equivalent to drinking three cups of coffee at one sitting." Of course, the imagination revives many experiences at a time, not just seeing, but the visual image makes a mental simulation especially vivid. 286 Imagery is an industry. Courses on How to Improve Your Memory teach age-old tricks like imagining items in the rooms of your house and then mentally walking through it, or finding a visual allusion in a persons name and linking it to his face (if you were introduced to me, you would imagine me in a cerise leisure suit). Phobias are often treated by a kind of mental Pavlovian conditioning where an image substitutes for the bell. The patient relaxes deeply and then imagines the snake or spider, until the image and, by extension, the real thing is associated with the relaxation. Highly paid "sports psychologists" have athletes relax in a comfy chair and visualize the perfect swing. Many of these techniques work, though some are downright flaky. I am skeptical of cancer therapies in which patients visualize their antibodies munching the tumor, even more so when it is the patients support group that does the visualizing. (A woman once called to ask if I thought it would work over the Internet.) But what is a mental image? Many philosophers with behaviorist leanings think the whole idea is a terrible blunder. An image is supposed to be a picture in the head, but then you would need a little man et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. In fact, the computational theory of mind makes the notion perfectly straightforward. We already know that the visual system uses a 2lh-D sketch which is picturelike in several respects. It is a mosaic of elements that stand for points in', 'But people do not '),
(224, 48, 3, 'but when it comes to consciousness we have no choice but to begin by disentangling the meanings. Sometimes "consciousness" is just used as a lofty synonym for "intelligence." Gould, for example, must have been using it in this way. But there are three more-specialized meanings, nicely distinguished by the linguist Ray Jackendoff and the philosopher Ned Block. One is self-knowledge. Among the various people and objects that an intelligent being can have information about is the being itself. Not only can I feel pain and see red, I can think to myself, "Hey, here I am, Steve Pinker, feeling pain and seeing red!" Oddly enough, this recondite sense of the word is the one that most academic discussions have in mind. Consciousness is typically defined as "building an internal model of the world that contains the self," "reflecting back on ones own mode of understanding," and other kinds of navel-gazing that have nothing to do with consciousness as it is commonly understood: being alive and awake and aware. Self-knowledge, including the ability to use a mirror, is no more mysterious than any other topic in perception and memory. If I have a mental database for people, whats to prevent it from containing an entry for myself? If I can learn to raise my arm and crane my neck to sight a hidden spot on my back, why couldnt I learn to raise a mirror and look up at it to sight a hidden spot on my forehead? And access to information about the self is perfectly easy to model. Any beginning programmer can write a short piece of software that examines, reports on, and even modifies itself. A robot that could recognize itself in a mirror would not be much more difficult to build than a robot that could recognize anything at all. There are, to be sure, good questions to ask about the evolution of self-knowledge, its development in children, and its advantages (and, more interesting, disadvantages, as we shall see in Chapter 6). But selfknowledge is an everyday topic in cognitive science, not the paradox of Thinking Machines 135 water becoming wine. Because it is so easy to say something about selfknowledge, writers can crow about their "theory of consciousness." A second sense is access to information. I ask, "A penny for your thoughts?" You reply by telling me the content of your daydreams, your plans for the day, your aches and itches, and the colors, shapes, and sounds in front of you. But you cannot tell me about the enzymes secreted by your stomach, the current settings of your heart and breathing rate, the computations in your brain that recover 3-D shapes from the 2-D retinas, the rules of syntax that order the words as you speak, or the sequence of muscle contractions that allow you to pick up a glass. That shows that the mass of information processing in the nervous system falls into two pools. One pool, which includes the products of vision and the contents of shortterm memory, can be accessed by the systems underlying verbal reports, rational thought, and deliberate decision making. The other pool, which includes autonomic (gut-level) responses, the internal calculations behind vision, language, and movement, and repressed desires or memories (if there are any), cannot be accessed by those systems. Sometimes information can pass from the first pool to the second or vice versa. When we first learn how to use a stick shift, every motion has to be thought out, but with practice the skill becomes automatic. With intense concentration and biofeedback, we can focus on a hidden sensation', 'but when it comes '),
(225, 49, 3, 'but you fool all of the people all the time." Without an ability to compute quantification, we could not understand what he said. In these examples, we have several sentences, or several readings of an ambiguous sentence, in which the same concepts play the same roles but the ideas as a whole are very different. Hooking up concepts to their roles is not enough. Logicians capture these distinctions with variables and quantifiers. A variable is a place-holding symbol like x or y which stands for the same entity across different propositions or different parts Thinking Machines 123 of one proposition. A quantifier is a symbol that can express "There exists a particular x who . . ." and "For all x it is true that" A thought can then be captured in a proposition built out of symbols for concepts, roles, quantifiers, and variables, all precisely ordered and bracketed. Compare, for example, "Every forty-five seconds {there exists an X [who gets injured]}" with "There exists an X {who every forty-five seconds [gets injured]}." Our mentalese must have machinery that does something similar. But so far, we have no hint as to how this can be done in an associative network. Not only can a proposition be about an individual, it must be treated as a kind of individual itself, and that gives rise to a new problem. Connectoplasm gets its power from superimposing patterns in a single set of units. Unfortunately, that can breed bizarre chimeras or make a network fall between two stools. It is part of a pervasive bugaboo for connectoplasm called interference or cross-talk. Here are two examples. The psychologists Neal Cohen and Michael McCloskey trained a network to add two digits. They first trained it to add 1 to the other numbers: when the inputs were "1" and "3," the network learned to put out "4," and so on. Then they trained it to add 2 to any other number. Unfortunately, the add-2 problem sucked the connection weights over to values that were optimal for adding 2, and because the network had no hardware set aside to anchoring the knowledge of how to add 1, it became amnesic for how to add 1! The effect is called "catastrophic forgetting" because it is unlike the mild forgetting of everyday life. Another example comes from a network designed by McClelland and his collaborator Alan Kawamoto to assign meanings to ambiguous sentences. For example, A bat broke the window can mean either that a baseball bat was hurled at it or that a winged mammal flew through it. The network came up with the one interpretation that humans do not make: a winged mammal broke the window using a baseball bat! As with any other tool, the features that make connectoplasm good for some things make it bad for other things. A networks ability to generalize comes from its dense interconnectivity and its superposition of inputs. But if youre a unit, its not always so great to have thousands of other units yammering in your ear and to be buffeted by wave after wave of inputs. Often different hunks of information should be packaged and stored separately, not blended. One way to do this is to give each proposition its own storage slot and address once again showing that not all aspects of computer design can be dismissed as silicon curiosities. Com124 puters, after all, were not designed as room heaters; they were1 designed to process information in a way that is meaningful to human users. The psychologists David Sherry and Dan Schacter have pujshed this line of', 'but you fool all '),

The agents are thought to have an internal and renewable source of energy, force, impetus, or oomph, which they use to propel themselves, usually in service of a goal. These agents are animals, of course, including humans. Science tells us that they follow physical laws, just like everything else in the universe; its just that the matter in motion consists of tiny little molecules in muscles and brains. But outside the neurophysiology lab ordinary thinkers have to assign them to a different category of uncaused causers. Infants divide the world into the animate and the inert early in life. Three-month-olds are upset by a face that suddenly goes still but not by an object that suddenly stops moving. They try to bring objects toward them by pushing things, but try to bring people toward them by making noise. By six or seven months, babies distinguish between how hands act upon objects and how other objects act upon objects. They have opposite expectations about what makes people move and what makes objects move: objects launch each other by collisions; people start and stop on their own. By twelve months, babies interpret cartoons of moving dots as if the dots were seeking goals. For example, the babies are not surprised when a dot that hops over a barrier on its way to another dot makes a beeline after the barrier is removed. Three-year-olds describe dot cartoons much as we do, and have no trouble distinguishing things that move on their own, like animals, from things that dont, like dolls, statues, and lifelike animal figurines. Intuitions about self-propelled agents overlap with three other major Good Ideas 323 ways of knowing. Most agents are animals, and animals, like plants and minerals, are categories that we sense are given by nature. Some selfpropelled things, like cars and windup dolls, are artifacts. And many agents do not merely approach and avoid goals but act out of beliefs and desires; that is, they have minds. Lets look at each of them. People everywhere are fine amateur biologists. They enjoy looking at animals and plants, classify them into groups that biologists recognize, predict their movements and life cycles, and use their juices as medicines, poisons, food additives, and recreational drugs. These talents, which have adapted us to the cognitive niche, come from a mode of understanding the world called folk biology, though "folk natural history" may be a more apt term. People have certain intuitions about natural kinds roughly, the sorts of things found in a museum of natural history, such as animals, plants, and minerals that they dont apply to artifacts, such as coffeepots, or to kinds stipulated directly by rules, such as triangles and prime ministers.

But suppose you learned that a decade ago lions were hunted to extinction in Africa and survive only in American zoos. Suppose scientists discovered that lions werent innately ferocious; they get that way in a dysfunctional family but otherwise grow up like Bert Lahr in the Wizard of Oz. Suppose it turned out that they were not even cats. I had a teacher who insisted that lions really belonged in the dog family, and though she was wrong, she could have been right, just as whales turned out to be mammals, not fish.

They shove each other and trade insults and obscenities. The loser, humiliated before onlookers, storms off and returns with a gun. The murders are the epitome of "senseless violence," and the men who commit them are often written off as madmen or animals. Daly and Wilson point out that these men behave as if a great deal more is at stake than the use of a pool table. And a great deal more is at stake: Men are known by their fellows as "the sort who can be pushed around" and "the sort who wont take any shit," as people whose word means action or people who are full of hot air, as guys whose girlfriends you can chat up with impunity or guys you dont want to mess with. In most social milieus, a mans reputation depends in part upon the maintenance of a credible threat of violence. Conflicts of interest are endemic to society, and ones interests are likely to be violated by competitors unless those competitors are deterred. Effective deterrence is a matter of convincing our rivals that any attempt to advance their interests at our expense will lead to such severe penalties that the competitive gambit will end up a net loss which should never have been undertaken. The credibility of the deterrent can be devalued by a public challenge that is not taken up, even if nothing tangible is at stake. Moreover, if a challenger knew that his target was a cool calculator of costs and beneFamily Values 497 fits, he could extort him into backing down with the threat of a fight that was dangerous to both.

The ghetto gang member who stabs the guy who dissed him has honorable counterparts in all the worlds cultures. The very meaning of the word honor in many languages (including one of its senses in English) is a determination to avenge insults, with bloodshed if necessary. In many foraging societies a boy achieves manly status only after he has killed. A mans respect increases with his verified body count, giving rise to charming customs like scalping and headhunting. Dueling between "men of honor" was traditional in the American South, and many men rose to leadership with the help of their success in duels. The man on the ten-dollar bill, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, was killed in a duel by Vice President Aaron Burr, and the man on the twenty, President Andrew Jackson, won two duels and tried to provoke others. Why dont we see periodontists or college professors dueling over a parking space? First, they live in a world in which the state has a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence. In places beyond the reach of the state, like urban underworlds or rural frontiers, or in times when the state did not exist, like the foraging bands in which we evolved, a credible threat of violence is ones only protection. Second, the assets of periodontists and professors, such as houses and bank accounts, are hard to steal. "Cultures of honor" spring up when a rapid response to a threat is essential because ones wealth can be carried away by others.

(228, 52, 3, 'choice guarantees fortune or happiness; the best one can do is play the odds. Stripped to its essentials, every decision in life amounts to choosing which lottery ticket to buy. Say a ticket costs $ 1.00 and offers a one-in-four chance of winning $10.00. On average, you will net $1.50 per play ($10.00 divided by 4 equals $2.50, minus $1.00 for the ticket). The other ticket costs $ 1.00 and offers a one-in-five chance of winning $12.00. On average, you will net $1.40 per play The two kinds of tickets come in equal numbers, and neither has the odds or winnings marked on it. How much should you pay for someone to tell you which is which:1 You should pay up to four cents. With no information, you would have to choose at random, and you could expect to make $1.45 on average ($1.50 half the time, $1.40 half the time). If you knew which had the better average payoff, you would make an average of $1.50 each play, so even if you paid four cents you would be ahead by one cent each play. Most organisms dont buy lottery tickets, but they all choose between gambles every time their bodies can move in more than one way. They should be willing to "pay" for information in tissue, energy, and time if the cost is lower than the expected payoff in food, safety, mating opportunities, and other resources, all ultimately valuated in the expected number of surviving offspring. In multicellular animals the information is gathered and translated into profitable decisions by the nervous system. Often, more information brings a greater reward and earns back its extra cost. If a treasure chest has been buried somewhere in your neighborhood, the single bit of information that locates it in the north or the south half is helpful, because it cuts your digging time in half. A second bit that told you which quadrant it was in would be even more useful, and so on. The more digits there are in the coordinates, the less time you will waste digging fruitlessly, so you should be willing to pay for more bits, up to 176 the point where you are so close that further subdivision would not be worth the cost. Similarly, if you were trying to crack a combination lock, every number you bought would cut down the number of possibilities to try, and could be worth its cost in the time saved. So very often more information is better, up to a point of diminishing returns, and that is why some lineages of animals have evolved more and more complex nervous isystems. Natural selection cannot directly endow an organism with information about its environment, or with the computational networks, demons, modules, faculties, representations, or mental organs that process the information. It can only select among genes. But genes build brains, and different genes build brains that process information in different ways. The evolution of information processing has to be accomplished at the nuts-and-bolts level by selection of genes that affect the brain-assembly process. Many kinds of genes could be the targets of selection for better information processing. Altered genes could lead to different numbers of proliferative units along the walls of the ventricles (the cavities in the center of the brain), which beget the cortical neurons making up the gray matter. Other genes could allow the proliferative units to divide for different numbers of cycles, creating different numbers and kinds of cortical areas.

Apparently if you believe that any aspect of an organism has a function, you absolutely must believe that every aspect has a function, that monkeys are brown to hide amongst the coconuts. The geneticist Richard Lewontin, for example, has defined adaptationism as "that approach to evolutionary studies which assumes without further proof that all aspects of the morphology, physiology and behavior of organisms are adaptive optimal solutions to problems." Needless to say, there is no such madman. A sane person can believe that a complex organ is an adaptation, that is, a product of natural selection, while also believing that features of an organism that are not 166 J complex organs are a product of drift or a by-product of some other adaptation. Everyone acknowledges that the redness of blood was not selected for itself but is a by-product of selection for a molecule that carries oxygen, which just happens to be red. That does not imply that the lability of the eye to see could easily be a by-product of selection for something else. There also are no benighted fools who fail to realize that animals carry baggage from their evolutionary ancestors. Readers young enough to have had sex education or old enough to be reading articles about the prostate may have noticed that the seminal ducts in men do pot lead directly from the testicles to the penis but snake up into the body and pass over the ureter before coming back down. That is because the testes of our reptilian ancestors were inside their bodies. The bodies of mammals are too hot for the production of sperm, so the testes gradually descended into a scrotum. Like a gardener who snags a hose around a tree, natural selection did not have the foresight to plan the shortest route. Again, that does not mean that the entire eye could very well be useless phylogenetic baggage. Similarly, because adaptationists believe that the laws of physics are not enough to explain the design of animals, they are also imagined to be prohibited from ever appealing to the laws of physics to explain anything. A Darwin critic once defiantly asked me, "Why has no animal evolved the ability to disappear and instantly reappear elsewhere, or to turn into King Kong at will (great for frightening predators)?" I think it is fair to say that "not being able to turn into King Kong at will" and "being able to see" call for different kinds of explanations. Another accusation is that natural selection is a sterile exercise in after-the-fact storytelling. But if that were true, the history of biology would be a quagmire of effete speculation, with progress having to wait for todays enlightened anti-adaptationists. Quite the opposite has happened. Mayr, the author of a definitive history of biology, wrote, The adaptationist question, "What is the function of a given structure or organ?" has been for centuries the basis of every advance in physiology. If it had not been for the adaptationist program, we probably would still not yet know the functions of thymus, spleen, pituitary, and pineal.

In some fishes, the male broods the young in a pouch. In some birds, the male sits on the egg and feeds the young. In those species, the females are aggressive and try to court the males, who select partners carefully. In a typical mammal, though, the female does almost all the investing. Mammals have opted for a body plan in which the female carries the fetus inside her, nourishes it with her blood, and nurses and protects it after it is born until the offspring has grown big enough to fend for itself. The male contributes a few seconds of copulation and a sperm cell Family Values 465 weighing one ten-trillionth of a gram. Not surprisingly, male mammals compete for opportunities to have sex with female mammals. The details depend on the rest of the animals way of life. Females live alone or in groups, in small groups or large ones, in stable groups or temporary ones, using sensible criteria like where the food is, where its safest, where they can easily bear and raise young, and whether they need strength in numbers. Males go where the females are. Female elephant seals, for example, congregate on beach strips which a male can easily patrol. A single male can monopolize the group, and males fight bloody battles for this jackpot. Bigger fighters are better fighters, so the males have evolved to be four times the size of the females. Apes have a wide variety of sexual arrangements. That means, by the way, that there is no such thing as an "ape legacy" that humans are doomed to live by. Gorillas live on the fringes of forests in small groups of one male and several females, and the males fight each other for control over females, the males evolving to be twice the females size. Gibbon females are solitary and widely dispersed, and the male finds a females territory and acts as a faithful consort. Since other males are off in other territories, they fight no more than females do and are no bigger. Orangutan females are solitary but close enough together that a male can monopolize two or more of their ranges, and the males are about 1.7 times the size of the females. Chimps live in large, unstable groups that no male could dominate. Groups of males live with the females, and the males compete for dominance, which confers more opportunities to copulate. The males are about 1.3 times as large as the females. With lots of males around, a female has an incentive to mate with many of them so that a male can never be sure that an infant is not his and hence will not murder the infant to make its mother available to bear his own offspring. Bonobo (pygmy chimp) females are almost indiscriminately promiscuous, and the males fight less and are about the same size as females. They compete in a different way: inside the females bodies. Sperm can survive in the vagina for several days, so a promiscuous female can have several males sperm competing inside her for a chance at fertilizing the egg. The more sperm a male produces, the greater the chance that one of his will get there first. That explains why chimpanzees have enormous testicles for their body size. Bigger testes make more sperm, which have a better chance inside promiscuous females. A gorilla is four times the weight of a chimpanzee, but his', 'difference in investment between '),

How does activity in layer 4 of the cortex cause my private, pungent, tangy sensation of redness? I can imagine a creature whose layer 4 is active but who does not have the sensation of red or the sensation of anything; no law of biology rules the creature out. No account of the causal effects of the cingulate sulcus can explain how human choices are are not caused at all, hence something we can be held responsible for. Theories of the evolution of the moral sense can explain why we condemn evil acts against ourselves and our kith and kin, but cannot explain the conviction, as unshakable as our grasp of geometry, that some acts are inherently wrong even if their net effects are neutral or beneficial to our overall well-being. I am partial to a different solution, defended by McGinn and based on speculations by Noam Chomsky, the biologist Gunther Stent, and before them David Hume. Maybe philosophical problems are hard not because they are divine or irreducible or meaningless or workaday science, but because the mind of Homo sapiens lacks the cognitive equipment to solve them. We are organisms, not angels, and our minds are organs, not pipelines to the truth. Our minds evolved by natural selection to solve problems that were life-and-death matters to our ancestors, not to commune with correctness or to answer any question we are capable of asking. We cannot hold ten thousand words in short-term memory. We cannot see in ultraviolet light. We cannot mentally rotate an object in the fourth dimension. And perhaps we cannot solve conundrums like free will and sentience. 562 We can well imagine creatures with fewer cognitive faculties than we have: dogs to whom our language sounds like "Blah-blah-blah-Gingerblah- blah," rats that cannot learn a maze with food in the prime-numbered arms, autistics who cannot conceive of other minds, children who cannot understand what the fuss around sex is about, neurological patients who see every detail in a face except whose it is, stereoblind people who can understand a stereogram as a problem in geometry but cannot see it pop out in depth. If stereoblind people did not know better, they might call 3-D vision a miracle, or claim that it just is and needs no explanation, or write it off as some kind of trick. So why should there not be creatures with more cognitive faculties than we have, or with different ones? They might readily grasp how free will and consciousness emerge from a brain and how meaning and morality fit into the universe, and would be amused by the religious and philosophical headstands we do to make up for our blankness when facing these problems. They could try to explain the solutions to us, but we would not understand the explanations. The hypothesis is almost perversely unprovable, though it could be disproved if anyone ever solved the age-old puzzles of philosophy. And there are indirect reasons to suspect it is true. One is that the species best minds have flung themselves at the puzzles for millennia but have made no progress in solving them. Another is that they have a different character from even the most challenging problems of science. Problems such as how a child learns language or how a fertilized egg becomes an organism are horrendous in practice and may never be solved completely.

Or wallow naked in December snow By thinking on fantastic summers heat? Clearly an image is different from an experience of the real thing. William James said that images are "devoid of pungency and tang." But in a 1910 Ph.D. thesis, the psychologist Cheves W. Perky tried to show that images were like very faint experiences. She asked her subjects to form a mental image, say of a banana, on a blank wall. The wall was actually a rear-projection screen, and Perky surreptitiously projected a real but dim slide on it. Anyone coming into the room at that point would have seen the slide, but none of the subjects noticed it. Perky claimed that they had incorporated the slide into their mental image, and indeed, the subjects reported details in their image that could only have come from the slide, such as the bananas standing on end. It was not a great experiment by modern standards, but state-of-the-art methods have borne out the crux of the finding, now called the Perky effect: holding a mental image interferes with seeing faint and fine visual details. Imagery can affect perception in gross ways, too. When people answer questions about shapes from memory, like counting off the right angles in a block letter, their visual-motor coordination suffers. (Since learning about these experiments I try not to get too caught up in a hockey game on the radio while I am driving.) Mental images of lines can affect perception just as real lines do: they make it easier to judge alignment and can even induce visual illusions. When people see some shapes and imagine others, later they sometimes have trouble remembering which was which. So do imagery and vision share space in the brain? The neuropsychologists Edoardo Bisiach and Claudio Luzzatti studied two Milanese patients with damage to their right parietal lobes that left them with visual neglect syndrome. Their eyes register the whole visual field, but they attend only to the right half: they ignore the cutlery to the left of the plate, draw a face with no left eye or nostril, and when describing a room, ignore large details like a piano on their left. Bisiach and Luzzatti asked the patients to imagine standing in the Piazza del Duomo in Milan facing the cathedral and to name the buildings in the piazza. The The Minds Eye 289 patients named only the buildings that would be visible on the right neglecting the left half of imaginary space! Then the patients were asked to mentally walk across the square and stand on the cathedral steps facing the piazza and describe what was in it. They mentioned the buildings that they had left out the first time, and left out the buildings that they had mentioned. Each mental image depicted the scene from one vantage point, and the patients lopsided window of attention examined the image exactly as it examined real visual inputs. These discoveries implicate the visual brain as the seat of imagery, and recently there has been a positive identification. The psychologist Stephen Kosslyn and his colleagues used Positron Emission Tomography (PET scanning) to see which parts of the brain are most active when people have mental images. Each subject lay with his head in a ring of detectors, closed his eyes, and answered questions about uppercase letters of the alphabet, such as whether B has any curves.

In Isaac Bashevis Singers story "Schlemiel the First," a simpleton from the mythical village of Chelm sets out on a trip but loses his way and inadvertently returns home, thinking he has come across another village, which by an amazing coincidence looks just like his. He meets a woman who looks exactly like the wife he has grown tired of, and finds her ravishing. Another part of the male sexual mind is an ability to be easily aroused by a possible sex partner indeed, by the faintest hint of a possible sex partner. Zoologists have found that the males of many species will court an enormous range of objects having a vague resemblance to the female: other males, females of the wrong species, females of the right species that have been stuffed and nailed to a board, parts of stuffed females such as a head suspended in midair, even parts of stuffed females with important features missing like the eyes and the mouth. The male of the human species is aroused by the sight of a nude woman, not only in the flesh but in movies, photographs, drawings, postcards, dolls, and 472 I bit-mapped cathode-ray-tube displays. He takes pleasure in this mistaken identity, supporting a worldwide pornography industry which in the United States alone grosses ten billion dollars a year, almost as much as spectator sports and the movies combined. In foraging cultures, young men make charcoal drawings of breasts and vulvas on rock overhangs, carve them on tree trunks, and scratch them in the sand. Pornography is similar the world over and was much the same a century ago as it is today. It depicts in graphic physical detail a succession of anonymous nude females eager for casual, impersonal sex. It would make no sense for a woman to be easily aroused by the sight of a nude male. A fertile woman never has a shortage of willing sexual partners, and in that buyers market she can seek the best husband available, the best genes, or other returns on her sexual favors. If she could be aroused by the sight of a naked man, men could induce her to have sex by exposing themselves and her bargaining position would be compromised. The reactions of the sexes to nudity are quite different: men see nude women as a kind of invitation, women see nude men as a kind of threat. In 1992 a Berkeley student known around campus as the Naked Guy chose to jog, attend class, and eat in the dining halls in the nude as a protest against the repressive sexual traditions of Western society. He was expelled when some female students protested that his behavior should be classified as sexual harassment. Women do not seek the sight of naked male strangers or enactments of anonymous sex, and there is virtually no female market for pornography. (Playgirl, the supposed counterexample, is clearly for gay men. It has no ads for any product a woman would buy, and when a woman gets a subscription as a gag gift she finds herself on mailing lists for gay male pornography and sex toys.)

The relation of a shape to its mirror image gives rise to surprises, even paradoxes, in many branches of science. (They are explored in fascinating books by Martin Gardner and by Michael Corballis and Ivan Beale.) Consider the detached right and left hands of a mannequin. In one sense they are identical: each has four fingers and a thumb attached to a palm and a wrist. In another sense they are utterly different; one shape cannot be superimposed on the other. The difference lies only in how the parts are aligned with respect to a frame of reference in which all three axes are labeled with directions: updown, frontward-backward, left-right. When a right hand is pointing fingers- up palm-frontward (as in a "halt" gesture), its thumb points left; when a left hand is pointing fingers-up palm-frontward, its thumb points right. Thats the only difference, but it is real. The molecules of life have a handedness; their mirror images often do not exist in nature and would not work in bodies. A fundamental discovery of twentieth-century physics is that the universe has a handedness, too. At first that sounds absurd. For any object and event in the cosmos, you have no way of knowing whether you are seeing the actual event or its reflection in a mirror. You may protest that organic molecules and human-made objects like letters of the alphabet are an exception. The standard versions are all over the place and familiar; the mirror images are rare and can easily be recognized. But for a physicist, they dont count, because their handedness is a historical accident, not something ruled out by the laws of physics. On another planet, or on this one if we could rewind the tape of evolution and let it happen again, they could just as easily go the other way. Physicists used to think that this was true for everything in the universe. Wolfgang Pauli wrote, "I do not believe that the Lord is a weak left-hander," and Richard Feynman bet fifty dollars to one (he was unwilling to bet a hundred) that no experThe Minds Eye 277 iment would ever reveal a law of nature that looked different through the looking glass. He lost. The cobalt 60 nucleus is said to spin counterclockwise if you look down on its north pole, but that description by itself is circular because "north pole" is simply what we call the end of the axis from which a rotation looks counterclockwise. The logical circle would be broken if something else differentiated the so-called north pole from the so-called south pole. Here is the something else: when the atom decays, electrons are more likely to be flung out of the end we call south. "North" versus "south" and "clockwise" versus "counterclockwise" are no longer arbitrary labels but can be distinguished relative to the electron spurt. The decay, hence the universe, would look different in the mirror. God is not ambidextrous after all. So right- and left-handed versions of things, from subatomic particles to the raw material of life to the spin of the earth, are fundamentally different. But the mind usually treats them as if they were the same: Pooh looked at his two paws.

Men said "probably yes" as long as they had known the woman for a week. How short a time would a man have to know a woman before he would definitely not have sex with her? Buss never found out; his scale did not go down past "one hour." When Buss presented these findings at a university and explained them in terms of parental investment and sexual selection, a young woman raised her hand and said, "Professor Buss, I have a simpler explanation of your data." Yes, he said, what is it? "Men are slime." Are men really slime, or are they just trying to look like slime? Perhaps in questionnaires men try to exaggerate their studliness but women want to avoid looking easy. The psychologists R. D. Clark and Elaine Hatfield hired attractive men and women to approach strangers of the opposite sex on a college campus and say to them, "I have been noticing you around campus. I find you very attractive," and then ask one of three questions: (a) "Would you go out with me tonight?" (b) "Would you come over to my apartment tonight?" (c) "Would you go to bed with me tonight?" Half the women consented to a date. Half the men consented to a date. Six percent of the women consented to go to the stooges apartment. Sixty-nine percent of the men consented to go to the stooges apartment. None of the women consented to sex. Seventy-five percent of the men consented to sex. Of the remaining twenty-five percent, many were apologetic, asking for a rain check or explaining that they couldnt because their fiancee was in town. The results have been replicated in several states. When the studies were conducted, contraception was widely available and safe-sex practices were heavily publicized, so the results cannot be dismissed simply because women might be more cautious about pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. An awakening of male sexual desire by a new partner is known as the Coolidge effect, after a famous anecdote. One day President Calvin Coolidge and his wife were visiting a government farm and were taken on separate tours. When Mrs. Coolidge was shown the chicken pens, she asked whether the rooster copulated more than once a day. "Dozens Family Values 471 of times," replied the guide. "Please tell that to the president," Mrs. Coolidge requested. When the president was shown the pens and told about the rooster, he asked, "Same hen every time?" "Oh, no, Mr. President, a different one each time." The president said, "Tell that to Mrs. Coolidge." Many male mammals are indefatigable when a new willing female is available after each copulation. They cannot be fooled by the experimenter cloaking a previous partner or masking her scent. This shows, incidentally, that male sexual desire is not exactly "undiscriminating." Males may not care what kind of female they mate with, but they are hypersensitive to which female they mate with. It is another example of the logical distinction between individuals and categories that I argued was so important when criticizing associationism in Chapter 2. Men do not have the sexual stamina of roosters, but they show a kind of Coolidge effect in their desire over longer periods.

Fields was once asked, "Do you believe in clubs for young people?" He answered, "Only when kindness fails." The reply is not a sensible answer to a question about a recreational group, the usual meaning of club, but the anomaly may be resolved by switching to a second meaning, "weapon." Young people flip from being a target of beneficence to being a target of discipline. Koestlers three ingredients of humor incongruity, resolution, and indignity have been verified in many experiments of what makes a joke funny. Slapstick humor runs off the clash between a psychological frame, in which a person is a locus of beliefs and desires, and a physical frame, in which a person is a hunk of matter obeying the laws of physics. Scatological humor runs off the clash between the psychological frame and a physiological frame, in which a person is a manufacturer of disgusting substances. Sexual humor also runs off a clash between the psychological frame and a biological one; this time the person is a mammal with all the instincts and organs necessary for internal fertilization. Verbal humor hinges on a clash between two meanings of one word, the second one unexpected, sensible, and insulting. The Meaning of Life 551 The rest of Koestlers theory suffered from two old-fashioned ideas: the hydraulic model of the mind, in which psychic pressure builds up and needs a safety valve, and a drive for aggression, which supplies the pressure. To complete the answer to the question "What, if anything, is humor for?" we need three new ideas. First, dignity, stature, and the other balloons punctured by humor are part of the complex of dominance and status discussed in Chapter 7. Dominance and status benefit those who hold them at the expense of those who dont, so peons always have a motive to mount a challenge to the eminent. In humans, dominance is not just the spoil of victory in fighting but a nebulous aura earned by a recognition of effectiveness in any of the arenas in which humans interact: prowess, expertise, intelligence, skill, wisdom, diplomacy, alliances, beauty, or wealth. Many of these claims to stature are partly in the eye of the beholder and would disintegrate if the beholders changed their weightings of the strengths and weaknesses that sum to yield the persons worth. Humor, then, may be an anti-dominance weapon. A challenger calls attention to one of the many less-than-exalted qualities that any mortal, no matter how high and mighty, is saddled with. Second, dominance is often enforceable one-on-one but impotent before a united mob. A man with a single bullet in his gun can hold a dozen hostages if they have no way to signal a single moment at which to overpower him. No government has the might to control an entire population, so when events happen quickly and people all lose confidence in a regimes authority at the same time, they can overthrow it. This may be the dynamic that brought laughter that involuntary, disruptive, and contagious signal into the service of humor. When scattered titters swell into a chorus of hilarity like a nuclear chain reaction, people are acknowledging that they have all noticed the same infirmity in an exalted target. A lone insulter would have risked the reprisals of the target, but a mob of them, unambiguously in cahoots in recognizing the', 'for the laws of '),

Its helpful to distinguish the delight, perhaps the product of a useless technology for pressing our pleasure buttons, from the instruction, perhaps a product of a cognitive adaptation. The technology of fiction delivers a simulation of life that an audience can enter in the comfort of their cave, couch, or theater seat. Words can evoke mental images, which can activate the parts of the brain that register the world when we actually perceive it. Other technologies violate the assumptions of our perceptual apparatus and trick us with illusions that partly duplicate the experience of seeing and hearing real events. They include costumes, makeup, sets, sound effects, cinematography, and animation. Perhaps in the near future we can add virtual reality to the list, and in the more distant future the feelies of Brave New World. When the illusions work, there is no mystery to the question "Why do people enjoy fiction?" It is identical to the question "Why do people enjoy life?" When we are absorbed in a book or a movie, we get to see breathtaking landscapes, hobnob with important people, fall in love with ravishing men and women, protect loved ones, attain impossible goals, and defeat wicked enemies. Not a bad deal for seven dollars and fifty cents! Of course, not all stories have happy endings. Why would we pay seven dollars and fifty cents for a simulation of life that makes us miserable? Sometimes, as with art films, it is to gain status through cultural machismo. We endure a pummeling of the emotions to differentiate ourselves from the crass philistines who actually go to the movies to enjoy themselves. Sometimes it is the price we pay to satisfy two incompatible desires: stories with happy endings and stories with unpredictable end540 J ings, which preserve the illusion of a real world. There have to be some stories in which the murderer does catch up with the heroine in the basement, or we would never feel suspense and relief in the stories in which she escapes. The economist Steven Landsburg observes that happy endings predominate when no director is willing to sacrifice the popularity of his or her film for the greater good of more suspense in the movies in general. But then how can we explain the tearjerker, aimed at a market of moviegoers who enjoy being defrauded into grief? The psychologist Paul Rozin lumps tearjerkers with other examples of benign masochism like smoking, riding on roller coasters, eating hot chili peppers, and sitting in saunas. Benign masochism, recall, is like the drive of Tom Wolfes test pilots to push the outside of the envelope. It expands the range of options in life by testing, in small increments, how closely one can approach a brink of disaster without falling over it. Of course the theory would be vacuous if it offered a glib explanation for every inexplicable act, and it would be false if it predicted that people would pay to have needles stuck under their fingernails. But the idea is more subtle. Benign masochists must be confident that no serious harm will befall them. They must bring on the pain or fear in measured increments. And they must have an opportunity to control and mitigate the', 'found in all peoples '),

In our ancestors nomadic lifestyle, without an ability to accumulate possessions or to count on long-lived social institutions like depositors insurance, the payoffs for consumption must have been even higher. But even if they were not, some urge to indulge now had to have been built into our emotions. Most likely, we evolved a mechanism to estimate our longevity and the opportunities and risks posed by different choices (eating now or later, setting up camp or pushing on) and to tune the emotions accordingly. Hotheads 395 The political scientist James Q. Wilson and the psychologist Richard Herrnstein have pointed out that many criminals act as if they discount the future steeply. A crime is a gamble whose payoff is immediate and whose possible cost comes later. They attributed the discounting to low intelligence. The psychologists Martin Daly and Margo Wilson have a different explanation. In the American inner cities, life expectancy for young males is low, and they know it. (In Hoop Dreams, the documentary about aspiring basketball players in a Chicago ghetto, there is an arresting scene in which the mother of one of the boys rejoices that he is alive on his eighteenth birthday.) Moreover, the social order and long-term ownership rights which would guarantee that investments are repaid are tenuous. These are precisely the circumstances in which steeply discounting the future taking risks, consuming rather than investing is adaptive. More puzzling is myopic discounting: the tendency in all of us to prefer a large late reward to a small early one, but then to flip our preference as time passes and both rewards draw nearer. A familiar example is deciding before dinner to skip dessert (a small early reward) in order to lose weight (a large late one), but succumbing to temptation when the waiter takes the dessert orders. Myopic discounting is easy to produce in the lab: give people (or pigeons, for that matter) two buttons, one delivering a small reward now, the other delivering a larger reward later, and the subject will flip from choosing the large reward to choosing the small reward as the small one becomes imminent. The weakness of the will is an unsolved problem in economics and psychology alike.

Women report that looks and strength matter more in a lover than in a husband; as we shall see, looks are an indicator of genetic quality. And when women go through with an affair, they generally pick men of higher status than their husbands; the qualities that lead to status are almost certainly heritable (though a taste for prestigious lovers may also help with the first motive, extracting resources). Liaisons with superior men also may allow a woman to test her ability to trade up in the marriage market, either as a prelude to doing so or to improve her bargaining position within the marriage.

These women nevertheless managed to have several offspring, which the Trobrianders interpreted as conclusive proof of virgin birth. But more systematic research has shown that men, at least American college students, do have some preferences in a short-term partner. They rate looks as important; as we shall see, beauty is a signal of fertility and genetic quality. Promiscuity and sexual experience are also rated as assets. As Mae West explained, "Men like women with a past because they hope history will repeat itself." But these assets turn into liabilities when the men are asked about long-term partners. They subscribe to the infamous madonna-whore dichotomy, which divides the female sex into loose women, who may be dismissed as easy conquests, and coy women, who are valued as potential wives. This mentality is often called a symptom of misogyny, but it is the optimal genetic strategy for males of any species that invest in their offspring: mate with any female that will let you, but make sure your consort does not mate with any other male. What should women look for in a husband? A bumper sticker from the 1970s read, "A woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle." But at least for women in foraging societies, that would have been an overstatement. When a foraging woman is pregnant, nursing, and bringing up children, she and the children are vulnerable to hunger, pro- . tein deficiency, predation, rape, kidnapping, and murder. Any man who Family Values 481 fathers her children should be put to good use in feeding and protecting them. From her point of view, he has nothing better to do, though from his point of view, there is an alternative: competing for and wooing other women. Men vary in their ability and willingness to invest in their children, so a woman should choose wisely. She should be impressed by wealth and status, or, in the case of men too young to have them, by portents that they will get them, such as ambition and industriousness. These are all useless unless the man hangs around once the woman becomes pregnant, and men have an interest in saying they will hang around whether or not they intend to. As Shakespeare wrote,', 'genes from the best-quality '),
(240, 64, 3, 'good candidate for an adaptation. The function would be to avoid the costs of inbreeding: a reduction in the fitness of offspring. There is a grain of biological truth behind the folklore that incest "thickens the blood" and the stereotypes of defective hillbillies and royal twits. Harmful mutations steadily drip into the gene pool. Some are dominant, cripple their bearers, and are soon selected out. But most are recessive and do no harm until they build up in the population and meet up with copies of themselves when two carriers mate. Since close relatives share genes, if they mate they run a much higher risk that two copies of a harmful recessive gene will match up in their offspring. Since all of us carry the equivalent of one to two lethal recessive genes, when a brother and sister mate they are quite likely to have a compromised offspring, both in theory and in the studies that have measured the risks. The same is true for mother-son and father-daughter matings (and, to a lesser extent, to matings between more distant kin). It stands to reason that humans (and many other animals) have evolved an emotion that makes the thought of sex with a family member a turnoff. Incest avoidance showcases the complicated software engineering behind our emotions for other people. We feel stronger bonds of affecFamily Values 457 tion to family members than to acquaintances or strangers. We clearly perceive the sexual attractiveness of family members, and even take pleasure in looking at them. But the affection and appreciation of beauty dont translate into a desire to copulate, though if the same emotions had been elicited by a nonrelative, the urge might be irresistible. The way a single bit of knowledge can turn lust into horror has been used to great dramatic effect in the dozens of plots that Polti classifies as "Involuntary crimes of love," of which Sophocles Oedipus Rex is the most famous. Incest avoidance has two twists. One is that different couplings within the family have different genetic costs and benefits, both for the participants and for the bystanders. We might expect sexual repugnance to be adjusted accordingly. For both males and females, the benefit of having a child with an immediate family member is that the child contains seventy-five percent of each parents genes, instead of the usual fifty percent (the extra twenty-five percent comes from the genes shared by the parents by virtue of their being related which are then passed on to the child). The costs are the risk of a deformed child and the forgone opportunity to have a child with someone else. The forgone opportunities, however, differ for males and females. Also, children are always sure who their mothers are but are not always sure who their fathers are. For both these reasons, incest has to be costed out separately for each of the possible couplings in a family. Neither a mother nor a son has any advantage in the mother coupling with the son as opposed to with the boys father that could offset the genetic risks. And since men are generally not attracted to women old enough to be their mothers, the net result is that mother-son incest virtually never happens. For incest between fathers and daughters and between brothers and sisters, the calculations come out differently depending on whose point of view we take. A hypothetical ancestral girl made pregnant by a brother or father would be precluded from having a child with a nonrelative for the nine months of pregnancy, and were she to keep the baby, for another', 'good candidate for an '),

And when people are given information in a format that meshes with the way they naturally think about probability, they can be remarkably accurate. The claim that our species is blind to chance is, as they say, unlikely to be true. 352 THE METAPHORICAL MIND We are almost ready to dissolve Wallaces paradox that a foragers mind is capable of calculus. The human mind, we see, is not equipped with an evolutionarily frivolous faculty for doing Western science, mathematics, chess, or other diversions. It is equipped with faculties to master the local environment and outwit its denizens. People form concepts that find the clumps in the correlational texture of the world. They have several ways of knowing, or intuitive theories, adapted to the major kinds of entities in human experience: objects, animate things, natural kinds, artifacts, minds, and the social bonds and forces we will explore in the next two chapters. They wield inferential tools like the elements of logic, arithmetic, and probability. What we now want to know is where these faculties came from and how they can be applied to modern intellectual challenges. Here is an idea, inspired by a discovery in linguistics. Ray Jackendoff points to sentences like the following: The messenger went from Paris to Istanbul. The inheritance finally went to Fred. The light went from green to red. The meeting went from 3:00 to 4:00. The first sentence is straightforward: someone moves from place to place. But in the others, things stay put. Fred could have become a millionaire when the will was read even if no cash changed hands but a bank account was signed over. Traffic signals are set in pavement and dont travel, and meetings arent even things that could travel. We are using space and motion as a metaphor for more abstract ideas. In the Fred sentence, possessions are objects, owners are places, and giving is moving. For the traffic light, a changeable thing is the object, its states (red and green) are places, and changing is moving. For the meeting, time is a line, the present is a moving point, events are journeys, beginnings and ends are origins and destinations. The spatial metaphor is found not only in talk about changes but in talk about unchanging states. Belonging, being, and scheduling are construed as if they were landmarks situated at a place: Good Ideas 353 The messenger is in Istanbul. The money is Freds. The light is red. The meeting is at 3:00. The metaphor also works in sentences about causing something to remain in a state: The gang kept the messenger in Istanbul. Fred kept the money. The cop kept the light red. Emilio kept the meeting on Monday. Why do we make these analogies? It is not just to co-opt words but to co-opt their inferential machinery. Some deductions that apply to motion and space also apply nicely to possession, circumstances, and time. That allows the deductive machinery for space to be borrowed for reasoning about other subjects. For example, if we know that X went to Y, we can infer that X was not at Y beforehand but is there now. By analogy, if we know that a possession goes to a person, we can infer that the person did not own the possession beforehand but owns it now. The analogy is close, though it is never exact: as a messenger travels he occupies a series of locations between Paris and Istanbul, but as Fred inherits the money it does not gradually come', 'had no instinct for '),

If they had thought of each piece as its own object, then seeing a single object would be a surprise, and two a bore. Control experiments measured how long infants looked at one versus two objects without having seen anything beforehand; these baseline times were subtracted out. Infants might have been expected to see the two pieces as two pieces, or, if they had mentally united them at all, to have used all the correlations among the features of an object as criteria: smooth silhouettes, common colors, common textures, and common motions. But apparently infants have an idea of objecthood early in life, and it is the core of the adult concept: parts moving together. When two sticks peeking out from behind the screen moved back and forth in tandem, babies saw them as a single object and were surprised if the raised screen revealed two. When they didnt move, babies did not expect them to be a single object, even though the visible pieces had the same color and texture. When a stick peeked out from behind the top edge and a red jagged polygon peeked out from behind the bottom edge, and they moved back and forth in tandem, babies expected them to be connected, even though they had nothing in common but motion. The child is parent to the adult in other principles of intuitive physics. One is that an object cannot pass through another object like a ghost. Renee Baillargeon has shown that four-month-old infants are surprised when a panel just in front of a cube somehow manages to fall back flat to the ground, right through the space that the cube should be occupying. Spelke and company have shown that infants dont expect an object to pass through a barrier or through a gap that is narrower than the object is. A second principle is that objects move along continuous trajectories: they cannot disappear from one place and materialize in another, as in the transporter room of the Enterprise. When an infant sees an object pass behind the left edge of a left screen and then seem to reappear from Good Ideas [ 3 19 behind the right edge of a right screen without moving through the gap between the screens, she assumes she is seeing two objects. When she sees an object pass behind the left screen, reappear at the other edge of the screen, cross the gap, and then pass behind the right screen, she assumes she is seeing one object. A third principle is that objects are cohesive. Infants are surprised when a hand picks up what looks like an object but part of the object stays behind. A fourth principle is that objects move each other by contact only no action at a distance. After repeatedly seeing an object pass behind a screen and another object pop out, babies expect to see one launching the other like billiard balls. They are surprised when the screen reveals one ball stopping short and the second just up and leaving. So three- to four-month-old infants see objects, remember them, and expect them to obey the laws of continuity, cohesion, and contact as they move. Babies are not as stoned as James, Piaget, Freud, and others thought. As the psychologist David Geary has said, James "blooming, buzzing confusion" is a good description of the parents life, not the infants. The discovery also overturns the suggestion that babies stop their world from spinning by manipulating', 'had visualized a single '),

Of course, in everyday life we dont have to overthrow tyrants or to humble kings, but we do have to undermine the pretensions of countless blowhards, blusterers, bullies, gasbags, goody-goodies, holier-than-thous, hotshots, know-it-alls, and prima donnas. 552 Third, the mind reflexively interprets other peoples words and gestures by doing whatever it takes to make them sensible and true. If the words are sketchy or incongruous, the mind charitably fills in missing premises or shifts to a new frame of reference in which they make sense. Without this "principle of relevance," language itself would be impossible. The thoughts behind even the simplest sentence are so labyrinthine that if we ever expressed them in full our speech would sound like the convoluted verbiage of a legal document. Say I were to tell you, "Jane heard the jingling ice cream truck. She ran to get her piggy bank from her dresser and started to shake it. Finally some money came out." Though I didnt say it in so many words, you know that Jane is a child (not an eighty-seven-year-old woman), that she shook the piggy bank (not the dresser), that coins (not bills) came out, and that she wanted the money to buy ice cream (not to eat the money, invest it, or bribe the driver to turn off the jingling). The jester manipulates this mental machinery to get the audience to entertain a proposition the one that resolves the incongruity against their will. People appreciate the truth of the disparaging proposition because it was not baldly asserted as a piece of propaganda they might reject but was a conclusion they deduced for themselves. The proposition must possess at least a modicum of warrant or the audience could not have deduced it from other facts and could not have gotten the joke. This explains the feeling that a witty remark may capture a truth that is too complex to articulate, and that it is an effective weapon that forces people, at least for a moment, to agree to things they would otherwise deny. Reagans wisecrack that abortion-rights advocates had already been born is so trivially true everyone has been born that on first hearing it makes no sense. But it does make sense on the assumption that there are two kinds of individuals, the born and the unborn. Those are the terms in which abortion opponents want the issue to be framed, and anyone who understands the quip has implicitly acknowledged that the framing is possible. And within that frame, the abortion-rights advocate possesses a privilege but wants to deny it to others and hence is a hypocrite. The argument is not necessarily sound, but a rebuttal would need many more words than the dozen that sufficed for Reagan. The "higher" forms of wit are cases where an audiences cognitive processes have been commandeered against them to deduce a disparaging proposition from premises they cannot deny. The Meaning of Life 553 Not all humor is malicious. Friends spend a good deal of time in playful badinage in which no one gets hurt; indeed, an evening spent laughing with friends is one of lifes greatest pleasures. Of course, much of the pleasure comes from disparaging people outside the circle, which reinforces the friendship by the principle that the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

A geine that made a fifteen-year-old want to nurse would foreclose an opportunity for his mother to manufacture new copies of that gene inside viable siblings. Either cost would exceed twice the benefit, so most organisms have their siblings interests at heart, though discounted relative to their own. The point of the theory is not that children want to take or that parents dont want to give; its that children want to take more than what their parents want to give. Parent-offspring conflict begins in the womb. A woman with an unborn child seems like a vision of harmony and nurturance, but beneath the glow a mighty battle goes on inside her. The fetus tries to mine the mothers body for nutrients at the expense of her ability to bear1 future Family Values 443 children. The mother is a conservationist, trying to keep her body in reserve for posterity. The human placenta is a tissue of the fetus that invades the mothers body and taps into her bloodstream. Through it the fetus secretes a hormone that ties up maternal insulin, increasing the levels of blood sugar which it can then skim off. But the resulting diabetes compromises the mothers health, and over evolutionary time she has fought back by secreting more insulin, which prompted the fetus to secrete more of the hormone that ties up insulin, and so on, until the hormones reached a thousand times their usual concentration. The biologist David Haig, who first noticed prenatal parent-offspring conflict, remarks that the raised hormone levels are like raised voices: a sign of conflict. In a similar tug-of-war, the fetus increases the mothers blood pressure, forcing more nutrients its way at the expense of her health. The battle continues once the baby is born. The first decision of motherhood is whether to let the newborn die. Infanticide has been practiced in all the worlds cultures. In ours, "killing babies" is a synonym for depravity, one of the most shocking crimes imaginable. One might think it is a form of Darwinian suicide and proof that other cultures values are incommensurable with ours. Daly and Wilson show that it is neither. Parents of all species face the choice of whether to continue to invest in a newborn. Parental investment is a precious resource, and if a newborn is likely to die there is no point in throwing good money after bad by fledging or suckling it. The time and calories would be better spent on its littermates or clutchmates, in starting over with new offspring, or in waiting until the circumstances are better. Thus most animals let their runtish or sickly offspring die. Similar calculations enter into human infanticide. In foraging peoples, women have their first child in their late teens, nurse them on demand for four infertile years, and see many die before adulthood. If a woman is lucky, she might raise two or three children to maturity. (The large broods of our grandparents are historical aberrations resulting from agriculture, which provided substitutes for mothers milk.) To raise even a small number of children to adulthood, a woman has to make hard choices. Women in the worlds cultures let infants die in circumstances in which the odds of survival are low: when the infant is deformed, a twin, fatherless, or fathered by a man who isnt the womans husband, and when the mother is young (and so has opportunities to try again),', 'having one mother milk '),

They endow us with selfish motives, but they just as surely endow us with the capacity for love and a sense of justice. What we should appreciate and fear is the cunning designs of the emotions themselves. Many of their specs are not for gladness and understanding: think of the happiness treadmill, the Sirens song, the sham emotions, the doomsday machines, the caprice of romance, the pointless punishment of grief. But self-deception is perhaps the crudest motive of all, for it makes us feel right when we are wrong and emboldens us to fight when we ought to surrender. Trivers writes, Consider an argument between two closely bound people, say, husband and wife. Both parties believe that one is an altruist of long standing, relatively pure in motive, and much abused while the other is characterized by a pattern of selfishness spread over hundreds of incidents. They only disagree over who is altruistic and who selfish.

The most popular answer was .95. The average answer was .56. The correct answer is .02, and only eighteen percent of the experts guessed it. The answer, according to Bayes theorem, may be calculated as the prevalence or base rate (1/1000) times the tests sensitivity or hit rate (proportion of sick people who test positive, presumably 1), divided by the overall incidence of positive test results (the percentage of the time the test comes out positive, collapsing over sick and healthy people that is, the sum of the sick people who test positive, 1/1000 X 1, and the healthy people who test positive, 999/1000 X .05). One bugaboo in the problem is that many people misinterpret "false positive rate" as the proportion of positive results that come from healthy people, instead of interpreting it as the proportion of healthy people who test positive. But the biggest problem is that people ignore the base rate (1/1000), which ought to have reminded them that the disease is rare and hence improbable for a given patient even if the test comes out positive.

So the concept of location must not be allowed to merge with the concepts of possession, circumstance, and time, but it can lend them some of its inferential rules. This sharing is what makes the analogies between location and other concepts good for something, and not just resemblances that catch our eye. The mind couches abstract concepts in concrete terms. It is not only words that are borrowed for metaphors, but entire grammatical constructions. The double-object construction Minnie sent Mary the marbles is dedicated to sentences about giving. But the construction can be co-opted for talking about communication: Minnie told Mary a story. Alex asked Annie a question. Carol wrote Connie a letter. 354 Ideas are gifts, communication is giving, the speaker is the sender, the audience is the recipient, knowing is having. Location in space is one of the two fundamental metaphors in language, used for thousands of meanings. The other is force, agency, and causation. Leonard Talmy points out that in each of the following pairs, the two sentences refer to the same event, but the events feel different to us: The ball was rolling along the grass. The ball kept on rolling along the grass. John doesnt go out of the house. John cant go out of the house. Larry didnt close the door. Larry refrained from closing the door. Shirley is polite to him. Shirley is civil to him. Margies got to go to the park. Margie gets to go to the park. The difference is that the second sentence makes us think of an agent exerting force to overcome resistance or overpower some other force. With the second ball-in-the-grass sentence, the force is literally a physical force. But with John, the force is a desire: a desire to go out which has been restrained. Similarly, the second Larry seems to house one psychic force impelling him to close the door and another that overpowers it. For Shirley, those psychodynamics are conveyed by the mere choice of the adjective civil. In the first Margie sentence, she is impelled to the park by an external force in spite of an internal resistance. In the second, she is propelled by an internal force that overcomes an external resistance. The metaphor of force and resistance is even more explicit in this family of sentences: Fran forced the door to open. Fran forced Sally to go. Fran forced herself to go. Good Ideas 355 The very same word, force, is being used literally and metaphorically, with a common thread of meaning that we easily appreciate.

It is the impetus theory I discussed earlier in the chapter, the core of peoples intuitive theory of physics. Space and force pervade language. Many cognitive scientists (including me) have concluded from their research on language that a handful of concepts about places, paths, motions, agency, and causation underlie the literal or figurative meanings of tens of thousands of words and constructions, not only in English but in every other language that has been studied.

Retaliation now would be sheer spite. But then, it is precisely this line of thinking that emboldened the Soviets to attack.

A deranged American officer has ordered a nuclear bomber to attack the Soviet Union, and it cannot be recalled.

Sex meant reproduction and vice versa. There was no food from domesticated plants or animals, so there was no baby formula; all children were breast-fed. There was also no paid day care, and no househusbands; babies and toddlers hung around with their mothers and other women. These conditions persisted through ninety-nine percent of our evolutionary history and have shaped our sexuality. Our sexual thoughts and feelings are adapted to a world in which sex led to babies, whether or not we want to make babies now. And they are adapted to a world in which children were a mothers problem more than a fathers. When I use terms like "should," "best," and Family Values 469 "optimal," they will be a shorthand for the strategies that would have led to reproductive success in that world. I will not be referring to what is morally right, attainable in the modern world, or conducive to happiness, which are different matters altogether. T h e first question of strategy is how many partners to want. Remember that when the minimum investment in offspring is greater for females, a male can have more offspring if he mates with many females, but a female does not have more offspring if she mates with many males one per conception is enough. Suppose a foraging man with one wife can expect two to five children with her. A premarital or extramarital liaison that conceives a child would increase his reproductive output by twenty to fifty percent. Of course, if the child starves or is killed because the father isnt around, the father is genetically no better off. The optimal liaison, then, is with a married woman whose husband would bring up the child. In foraging societies, fertile women are almost always married, so sex with a woman is usually sex with a married woman. Even if she is not, more fatherless children live than die, so a liaison with an unmarried partner can increase reproduction, too. None of this math applies to women. A part of the male mind, then, should want a variety of sexual partners for the sheer sake of having a variety of sexual partners. Do you think that the only difference between men and women is that men like women and women like men? Any bartender or grandmother you ask would say that men are more likely to have a wandering eye, but perhaps that is just an old-fashioned stereotype. The psychologist David Buss has looked for the stereotype in the people most likely to refute it men and women in elite liberal American universities a generation after the feminist revolution, in the heyday of politically correct sensibilities. The methods are refreshingly direct. Confidential questionnaires asked a series of questions. How strongly are you seeking a spouse? The answers were on average identical for men and women. How strongly are you seeking a one-night stand? The women said, Not very strongly; the men said, Pretty strongly. How many sexual partners would you like to have in the next month? In the next two years? In your lifetime? Women said that in the next month eight-tenths of a sexual partner would be just about right. They wanted 470 one in the next two years, and four or five over their lifetimes. Men wanted two sex partners within the month, eight in the next two years, and eighteen over their lifetimes.

The Minds Eye 213 When the current world resembles the average ancestral environment, we see the world as it is. When we land in an exotic world where the assumptions are violated because of a chain of unlucky coincidences or because a sneaky psychologist concocted the world to violate the assumptions we fall prey to an illusion. That is why psychologists are obsessed with illusions. They unmask the assumptions that natural selection installed to allow us to solve unsolvable problems and know, much of the time, what is out there. Perception is the only branch of psychology that has been consistently adaptation-minded, seeing its task as reverse-engineering. The visual system is not there to entertain us with pretty patterns and colors; it is contrived to deliver a sense of the true forms and materials in the world. The selective advantage is obvious: animals that know where the food, the predators, and the cliffs are can put the food in their stomachs, keep themselves out of the stomachs of others, and stay on the right side of the cliff top. The grandest vision of vision has come from the late artificial intelligence researcher David Marr. Marr was the first to describe vision as solving ill-posed problems by adding assumptions about the world, and was a forceful defender of the computational theory of mind. He also offered the clearest statement of what vision is for. Vision, he said, "is a process that produces from images of the external world a description that is useful to the viewer and not cluttered with irrelevant information." It may seem strange to read that the goal of vision is a "description." After all, we dont walk around muttering a play-by-play narration of everything we see. But Marr was referring not to a publicly spoken description in English but to an internal, abstract one in mentalese. What does it mean to see the world? We can describe it in words, of course, but we can also negotiate it, manipulate it physically and mentally, or file it away in memory for future reference. All these feats depend on construing the world as real things and stuff, not as the psychedelia of the retinal image. We call a book "rectangular," not "trapezoidal," though it projects a trapezoid on the retina. We mold our fingers into a rectangular (not trapezoidal) posture as we reach for it. We build rectangular (not trapezoidal) shelves to hold it, and we deduce that it can support a broken couch by fitting into the rectangular space beneath it. Somewhere in the mind there must be a mental symbol for "rectangle," delivered by vision but available at once to the rest of the verbal and non214 J verbal mind. That mental symbol, and the mental propositions that capture the spatial relations among objects ("book lying face down ion shelf near door"), are examples of the "description" that Marr charged vision with computing. If vision did not deliver a description, every mental faculty language, walking, grasping, planning, imagining would need its own procedure for deducing that the trapezoid on the retina is a rectangle in the world. That alternative predicts that a person who can call a slanted rectangle a "rectangle" may still have to learn how to hold it as a rectangle, how to predict that it will fit into rectangular spaces, and so on. That seems unlikely. When vision deduces the shape of', 'I will explain how '),

But the line of credit is long and the terms of repayment forgiving. Companionate love, then, does not literally contradict the theory of reciprocal altruism, but it does embody an elastic version in which the emotional guarantors liking, sympathy, gratitude, and trust are stretched to the limit. The facts of companionate love are clear enough, but why. did it evolve? Tooby and Cosmides have tried to reverse-engineer the psychology of friendship by calling attention to an aspect of the logic of exchange they call the Bankers Paradox. Many frustrated borrowers have learned that a bank will lend you exactly as much money as you can prove you dont need. As Robert Frost put it, "A bank is a place where they lend you an umbrella in fair weather and ask for it back when it begins to rain." The banks say they have only so much money to invest and every loan is a gamble. Their portfolio has to return a profit or they would go out of business, so they measure credit risks and weed out the worst. The same cruel logic applies to altruism among our ancestors. A person mulling over whether to extend a large favor is like a bank. He must worry net only about cheaters (is the beneficiary willing to repay?) but about bad credit risks (is the beneficiary able to repay?). If the recipient dies, is disabled, becomes a pariah, or leaves the group, the favor would have been wasted. Unfortunately, it is the bad credit risks the sick, starving, injured, and ostracized who most need favors. Anyone can 508 suffer a reversal of fortune, especially in the harsh life of a forager. Once abandoned, a stricken forager is not long for that world. What kinds of thoughts and feelings might evolve as a kind of insurance in which other people would extend "credit" to you even if misfortune were to make you a risk? One strategy is to make yourself irreplaceable. By cultivating expertise that no one in the group can duplicate, like toolmaking, wayfinding, or conflict resolution, you make yourself costly to abandon in times of need: everyone depends upon you too much to risk letting you die. People today do spend a lot of their social lives publicizing their unique and valuable talents or looking for a clique in which their talents would be unique and valuable. The quest for status is in part a motive for making oneself irreplaceable. Another is to associate with people who benefit from the things that benefit you. Merely by going about your life and pursuing your own interests, you can advance someone elses interests as a side effect. Marriage is the clearest example: the husband and wife share an interest in their childrens welfare. Another was pointed out by Mao Tse-tung in his little red book: "The enemy of my enemy is my friend." A third is to possess skills that benefit others at the same time that they benefit you, like being good at finding your way home. Other examples are living with a person who likes the room at the same temperature or who likes the same music. In all the examples, one delivers a benefit to someone without being altruistic in the biologists sense of incurring a cost and thereby needing a repayment to make the act worthwhile.

(252, 76, 3, 'ignore the clue grudgingly chalking up each mismatch as an exception to the cohesive-matter assumption? The psychologists Ken Nakayama and Shinsuke Shimojo have shown that natural selection did not ignore the clue. They created a random-dot stereogram whose depth information lay not in shifted dots but in dots that were visible in one eyes view and absent in the others. Those dots lay at the corners of an imaginary square, with dots at the top and bottom right comers only in the right eyes picture, and dots in the top and bottom left corners only in the left eyes picture. When people view the stereogram, they see a floating square defined by the four points, showing that the brain indeed interprets features visible to only one eye as coming from an edge in space. Nakayama and the psychologist Barton Anderson suggest that there arc neurons that detect these occlusions; they would respond to a pair of marks in one eye, one of which can be matched with a mark in the other eye and the other of which cannot be matched. These 3-D boundary detectors would help a stereo network home in on the outlines of the floating patches. Stereo vision does not come free with the two eyes; the circuitry has to be wired into the brain. We know this because about two percent of the population can see perfectly well out of each eyeball but not with the cyclopean eye; random-dot stereograms remain flat. Another four percent can see stereo only poorly An even larger minority has more selective deficits. Some cant see stereo depth behind the point of fixation; others cant see it in front. Whitman Richards, who discovered these forms of stereoblindness, hypothesized that the brain has three pools of neurons that detect differences in the position of a spot in the two eyes. One pool is for pairs of spots that coincide exactly or almost exactly, for fine-grained depth perception at the point of focus. Another is for pairs of spots Hanking the nose, for farther objects. A third is for pairs of spots approaching the temples, for nearer objects. Neurons with all these 238 properties have since been found in the brains of monkeys and cats. The different kinds of sterenblindness appear to be genetically determined, suggesting that each pool of neurons is installed by a different combination of genes. Stereo vision is not present at birth, and it can be permanently damaged in children or young animals if one of the eyes is temporarily deprived of input by a cataract or a patch. So far, this sounds like the tiresome lesson that stereo vision, like everything else, is a mixture of nature and nurture. But a better way of thinking about it is that the brain has to be assembled, and the assembly requires project scheduling over an extended timetable. The timetable does not care about when the organism is extruded from the womb; the installation sequence can carry on after birth. The process also requires, at critical junctures, the intake of information that the genes cannot predict. Stereo vision appears abruptly in infants. When newborns are brought into a lab at regular intervals, for week after week they are unimpressed by stereograms, and then suddenly they are captivated. Close to that epochal week, usually around three or four months of age, the babies converge their eyes properly for the first time (for example, they smoothly track a toy brought up to their nose), and they find rivalrous displays a different pattern in each eye annoying, whereas before they had found them interesting.

The Israeli communal villages called kibbutzim were founded early in the twentieth century by Utopian planners determined to break down the nuclear family. Boys and girls of the same age shared living quarters from shortly after birth through adolescence and were raised together by nurses and teachers. When they became sexually mature, the children who had grown up together very rarely married or even had sex, though marriages were not discouraged. In some parts of China, brides used to move into their inlaws homes, giving rise to frictions that you can well imagine. Parents hit on the brilliant idea of adopting a bride for their son when she was still a child, guaranteeing that she would forever be under her mother-in-laws thumb. What they did not realize was that the arrangement mimicked the psychological cues to siblinghood. When the couple grew up, they found each other unsexy, and compared with conventional couples, their marriages were unhappy, unfaithful, unfecund, and short. In parts of Lebanon, paternal parallel cousins grow up together as if they were siblings. Parents pressure the cousins into marrying, but the couples are sexually apathetic, relatively childless, and prone to divorce. Unconventional childrearing arrangements have been found to have the same outcome on all continents, and various alternative explanations can be ruled out. Conversely, people who do commit incest often have not grown up together. A study of sibling incest offenders in Chicago found that the only ones who had contemplated marriage were those who had been raised apart. Fathers who sexually abuse their daughters tend to have spent less time with them when they were small. Stepfathers who have had as much contact with their young stepdaughters as biological fathers do are no more likely to abuse them. There are anecdotes that adoptees who seek out their biological parents and siblings often find themselves sexually attracted to them, though I know of no controlled studies. The Westermarck effect explains the most famous incest offender of all: Oedipus. Laius, king of Thebes, was warned by an oracle that his son would slay him. When Jocasta, his wife, bore a son, he tied the baby up 460 J and left him exposed on a mountain. Oedipus was found and raised by a shepherd and then adopted by the king of Corinth and brought up as his son. On a visit to Delphi, Oedipus learned that he was fated to kill his father and marry his mother, so he left Corinth vowing never to return. On his way toward Thebes, he encountered Laius and killed him in a quarrel. When he then outwitted the Sphinx, his reward was the throne of Thebes and the hand of its widowed queen, Jocasta the biological mother he did not grow up with. They had four children before he got the bad news. But the ultimate triumph of the Westermarck theory has been pointed out by John Tooby. The idea that boys want to sleep with their mothers strikes most men as the silliest thing they have ever heard. Obviously it did not seem so to Freud, who wrote that as a boy he once had an erotic reaction to watching his mother dressing. But Freud had a wet-nurse, and may not have experienced the early intimacy that would have tipped off his perceptual system that Mrs. Freud was his mother.

In one episode, the comedian Ellen DeGeneres belongs to a reading club that has chosen a stereogram book as its weekly selection. Ashamed that she cannot see the illusions, she sets aside an evening to train herself, without success. In desperation she joins a support group for people who cannot "get" stereograms. Visual illusions fascinated people long before the psychologist Christopher Tyler inadvertently created this sensation in his research on binocular (two-eyed) vision. Simpler illusions made up of parallel lines that seem to converge and congruent lines that look unequal have long appeared in cereal-box reading material, Crackerjack prizes, childrens museums, and psychology courses. Their fascination is obvious. "Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?" says Groucho Marx to Margaret Dumont, playing on our faith that vision is a certain route to knowledge. As the sayings go: I call them as I see them; Seeing is believing; We have an eyewitness; I saw it with my own eyes. But if a devilish 211 212 display can make us see things that arent there, how can we trust our eyes at other times? Illusions are no mere curiosities; they set the intellectual agenda for centuries of Western thought. Skeptical philosophy, as old as philosophy itself, impugns our ability to know anything by rubbing our faces in illusions: the oar in the water that appears bent, the round tower that from a distance looks flat, the cold finger that perceives tepid water as hot while the hot finger perceives it as cold. Many of the great ideas of the Enlightenment were escape hatches from the depressing conclusions skeptical philosophers drew from illusions. We can know by faith, we can know by science, we can know by reason, we can know that we think and therefore that we are. Perception scientists take a lighter view. Vision may not work all the time, but we should marvel that it works at all. Most of the time we dont bump into walls, bite into plastic fruit, or fail to recognize our mothers. The robot challenge shows that this is no mean feat. The medieval philosophers were wrong when they thought that objects conveniently spray tiny copies of themselves in all directions and the eye captures a few and grasps their shape directly. We can imagine a science-fiction creature that embraces an object with calipers, prods it with probes and dipsticks, makes rubber molds, drills core samples, and snips off bits for biopsies. But real organisms dont have these luxuries. When they apprehend the world by sight, they have to use the splash of light reflected off its objects, projected as a two-dimensional kaleidoscope of throbbing, heaving streaks on each retina. The brain somehow analyzes the moving collages and arrives at an impressively accurate sense of the objects out there that gave rise to them. The accuracy is impressive because the problems the brain is solving are literally unsolvable. Recall from Chapter 1 that inverse optics, the deduction of an objects shape and substance from its projection, is an "ill-posed problem," a problem that, as stated, has no unique solution. An elliptical shape on the retina could have come from an oval viewed headon or a circle viewed at a slant. A patch of gray could have come from a snowball in the shade or a lump of coal in the sun. Vision has evolved to convert these ill-posed problems into solvable ones by adding premises: assumptions about how the world we evolved in is, on', 'in the Blondie comic '),

These frame shifts might be driven by copies of commands to the neck and body muscles, though they may also be driven by circuitry that tracks the slippage of the contents of the visual field. Another handy overlay would be a trapezoidal mental grid that marked out equal-sized extents in the world. A gridmark near our feet would cover a large stretch of the visual field; a gridmark near the horizon would cover a smaller stretch of the visual field but the same number of inches as measured along the ground. Since the 2V2-D sketch contains depth values at every point, the gridmarks would be easy for the brain to 264 calculate. This world-aligned reference frame would allow us to judge the genuine angles and extents of the matter outside our skin. The perceptual psychologist J. J. Gibson argued that we do have this sense of real-world scale superimposed on the retinal projection, and we can mentally flip between not using it and using it. Standing between the railroad tracks, we can assume one frame of mind in which we see the tracks converge, or another in which we see them as parallel. These two attitudes, which Gibson called "the visual field" and "the visual world," come from accessing the same information by either the retinal frame or a world-aligned frame. Yet another invisible frame is the direction of gravity. The mental plumb bob comes from the vestibular system of the inner ear, a labyrinth of chambers that includes three semicircular canals oriented at right angles to each other. If anyone doubts that natural selection uses principles of engineering rediscovered by humans, let them behold the XYZ Cartesian coordinate axes etched into the bones of the skull! As the head pitches, rolls, and yaws, fluid in the canals sloshes around and triggers neural signals registering the motion. A heavy mass of grit pressing down on other membranes registers linear motion and the direction of gravity. These signals can be used to rotate the mental crosshairs so they are always correctly pointing "up." That is why the world does not seem to list even though peoples heads are seldom plumb perpendicular. (The eyes themselves tilt clockwise and counterclockwise in the head, but only enough to undo small head tilts.) Oddly enough, our brains do not compensate for gravity very much. If the compensation were perfect, the world would look normal when we are lying sideways or even standing on our heads. Of course, it does not. Its hard to watch television lying on your side unless you prop your head on your hand, and its impossible to read unless you hold the book sideways. Perhaps because we are terrestrial creatures, we use the gravity signal mostly to keep our bodies upright rather than to compensate for out-of-kilter visual input when they are not. The coordination of the retinas frame with the inner ears frame affects our lives in a surprising way: it causes motion sickness. Ordinarily, when you move about, two signals work in synchrony: the swoops of texture and color in the visual field, and the messages about gravity and inertia sent by the inner ear. But if you are moving inside a container like a car, a boat, or a sedan chair evolutionarily unprecedented ways to get around the inner ear says, "Youre moving," but the walls and floor say, The Minds Eye 265 "Youre staying put."

The monkey in the movie does not instill the fear Hotheads 389 so much as awaken it, for if the film shows the monkey recoiling from a flower or a bunny instead of a snake, the viewer develops no fear. The ability to conquer fear selectively is an important component of the instinct. People in grave danger, such as pilots in combat or Londoners during the blitz, can be remarkably composed. No one knows why some people can keep their heads when all about them are losing theirs, but the main calming agents are predictability, allies within shouting distance, and a sense of competence and control, which the writer Tom Wolfe called The Right Stuff. In his book by that name about the test pilots who became Mercury astronauts, Wolfe defined the right stuff as "the ability [of a pilot] to go up in a hurtling piece of machinery and put his hide on the line and then have the moxie, the reflexes, the experience, the coolness, to pull it back in the last yawning moment." That sense of control comes from "pushing the outside of the envelope": testing, in small steps, how high, how fast, how far one can go without bringing on disaster. Pushing the envelope is a powerful motive. Recreation, and the emotion called "exhilaration," come from enduring relatively safe events that look and feel like ancestral dangers.

THE HAPPINESS TREADMILL The pursuit of happiness is an inalienable right, says the Declaration of Independence in its list of self-evident truths. The greatest happiness of the greatest number, wrote Jeremy Bentham, is the foundation of morality. To say that everyone wants to be happy sounds trite, almost circular, but it raises a profound question about our makeup. What is this thing that people strive for? At first happiness might seem like just desserts for biological fitness (more accurately, the states that would have led to fitness in the environment in which we evolved). We are happier when we are healthy, well-fed, comfortable, safe, prosperous, knowledgeable, respected, noncelibate, and loved. Compared to their opposites, these objects of striving are conducive to reproduction. The function of happiness would be to mobilize the mind to seek the keys to Darwinian fitness. When we are 390 unhappy, we work for the things that make us happy; when we are happy, we keep the status quo. The problem is, how much fitness is worth striving for? Ice Age people would have been wasting their time if they had fretted about their lack of camping stoves, penicillin, and hunting rifles or if they had striven for them instead of better caves and spears. Even among modern foragers, very different standards of living are attainable in different times and places.

Of course, we do not know that hyenas or lions have the concept of an individual; perhaps an odd man out just looks more appetizing. But the examples illustrate the computational problem of distinguishing individuals from classes, and they underscore the human minds facility in solving it. A second problem for associationism is called compositionality: the ability of a representation to be built out of parts and to have a meaning that comes from the meanings of the parts and from the way they are combined. Compositionality is the quintessential property of all human languages. The meaning of The baby ate the slug can be calculated from the meanings of baby, ate, the, and slug and from their positions in the sentence. The whole is not the sum of the parts; when the w0rds are rearranged into The slug ate the baby, a different idea is conveyed. Since you have never heard either sentence before, you must have interpreted them by applying a set of algorithms (incorporating the rules of syntax) to the strings of words. The end product in each case is a novel thought you assembled on the fly. Equipped with the concepts of babies, slugs, and eating, and with an ability to arrange symbols for them on a mental bulletin board according to a scheme that can be registered by the demons that read it, you can think the thought for the first time in your life.

But if that was all that happened in your mind, you would be in a fog as to whether the baby ate the slug, the slug ate the baby, or the baby and the slug ate.

Surely he did not believe that cows are rectangular or that triangles can do just fine without one of their angles. Something else in his head, not an image, must have embodied that knowledge. And that is the problem with other claims that all thoughts are images. Suppose I try to represent the concept "man" by an image of a prototypical man say, Fred MacMurray. The problem is, what makes the image serve as the concept "man" as opposed to, say, the concept "Fred MacMurray"? Or the concept "tall man," "adult," "human," "American," or "actor who plays an insurance salesman seduced into murder by Barbara Stanwyck"? You have no trouble distinguishing among a particular man, men in general, Americans in general, vamp-victims in general, and so on, so you must have more than a picture of a prototypical man in your head. And how could a concrete image represent an abstract concept, like "freedom"? The Statue of Liberty is already taken; presumably it is representing the concept "the Statue of Liberty." What would you use for negative concepts, like "not a giraffe"? An image of a giraffe with a red diagonal line through it? Then what would represent the concept "a giraffe with a red diagonal line through it"? How about disjunctive concepts, like "either a cat or a bird," or propositions, like "All men are mortal"? Pictures are ambiguous, but thoughts, virtually by definition, cannot be ambiguous. Your common sense makes distinctions that pictures by themselves do not; therefore your common sense is not just a collection of pictures. If a mental picture is used to represent a thought, it needs to be accompanied by a caption, a set of instructions for how to interpret the picture what to pay attention to and what to ignore. The captions cannot themselves be pictures, or we would be back where we started.

A sperm is small and cheap, so the organism might as well make many of them, and give them outboard motors to get to the egg quickly and an organ to launch them on their way. The egg is big and precious, so the organism had better give it a head start by packing it with food and a protective cover. That makes it more expensive still, so to protect the investment the organism evolves organs that let the fertilized egg grow inside the body and absorb even more food, and that release the new offspring only when it is large enough to survive. These structures are called male and female reproductive organs. A few animals, hermaphrodites, put both kinds of organs in every individual, but most specialize further and divide up into two kinds, each allocating all their reproductive tissue to one kind of organ or the other. They are called males and females. Trivers has worked out how all the prominent differences between males and females stem from the difference in the minimum size of their investment in offspring. Investment, remember, is anything a parent does that increases the chance of survival of an offspring while decreasing the parents ability to produce other viable offspring. The investment can be energy, nutrients, time, or risk. The female, by definition, begins with a bigger investment the larger sex cell and in most species commits herself to even more. The male contributes a puny package of genes and usually leaves it at that. Since every offspring requires one of each, 464 J the females contribution is the limiting step on how many offspring can be produced: at most, one offspring for each egg she creates and nurtures. Two cascades of consequences flow from this difference. First, a single male can fertilize several females, which forces other males to go mateless. That sets up a competition among males for access to females. A male may beat up other males to prevent them from getting to a female, or compete for the resources necessary to mate, or court a female to get her to choose him. Males therefore vary in reproductive success. A winner can beget many offspring, a loser will beget none. Second, the reproductive success of males depends on how many females they mate with, but the reproductive success of females does not depend on how many males they mate with. That makes females more discriminating. Males woo females and mate with any female that lets them. Females scrutinize males and mate only with the best ones: the ones with the best genes, the ones most willing and able to feed and protect her offspring, or the ones that the other females tend to prefer. Male competition and female choice are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom. Darwin called attention to these two spectacles, which he dubbed sexual selection, but was puzzled as to why it should be males that compete and females that choose rather than the other way around. The theory of parental investment solves the puzzle. The greater-investing sex chooses, the lesser-investing sex competes. Relative investment, then, is the cause of sex differences. Everything else testosterone, estrogen, penises, vaginas, Y chromosomes, X chromosomes is secondary. Males compete and females choose only because the slightly bigger investment in an egg that defines being female tends to get multiplied by the rest of the animals reproductive habits.

There is a 400 one-in-eight chance that a copy is lying inside a first cousin, and so on. A gene that built a brain that made its owner help its relatives would indirectly help to replicate itself. The biologist William Hamilton noted that if the benefit to the relative, multiplied by the probability that a gene is shared, exceeds the cost to the animal, that gene would spread in the population. Hamilton developed and formalized an idea that had been entertained by several other biologists as well, most famously in a wisecrack by the biologist J. B. S. Haldane when he was asked if he wiould lay down his life for his brother. "No," he said, "but for two brothers or eight cousins." When an animal behaves to benefit another animal at a cost to itself, biologists call it altruism. When altruism evolves because the altruist is related to the beneficiary so the altruism-causing gene benefits itself, they call it kin selection. But when we look into the psychology of the animal doing the behaving, we can give the phenomenon another name: love. The essence of love is feeling pleasure in anothers well-being and pain in its harm. These feelings motivate acts that benefit the loved one, like nurturing, feeding, and protecting. We now understand why many animals, including humans, love their children, parents, grandparents, grandchildren, siblings, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, and cousins: people helping relatives equals genes helping themselves. The sacrifices made for love are modulated by the degree of relatedness: people make more sacrifices for their children than for their nephews and nieces. They are modulated by the expected reproductive life of the beneficiary: parents sacrifice more for children, who have a longer life ahead of them, than children sacrifice for parents. And they are modulated by the beneficiarys own feelings of love. People love their grandmothers not because their grandmothers are expected to reproduce, but because their grandmothers love them, and love the rest of their family. That is, you help people who enjoy helping you and helping your relatives. That is also why men and women fall in love. The other parent of my child has as much of a genetic stake in the child as I do, so what is good for her is good for me. Many people think that the theory of the selfish gene says that "animals try to spread their genes." That misstates the facts and it misstates the theory. Animals, including most people, know nothing about genetics and care even less. People love their children not because they want to spread their genes (consciously or unconsciously) but because they cant help it. That love makes them try to keep their children warm, fed, and Hotheads 401 safe. What is selfish is not the real motives of the person but the metaphorical motives of the genes that built the person. Genes "try" to spread themselves by wiring animals brains so the animals love their kin and try to keep warm, fed, and safe. The confusion comes from thinking of peoples genes as their true self, and the motives of their genes as their deepest, truest, unconscious motives. From there its easy to draw the cynical and incorrect moral that all love is hypocritical. That confuses the real motives of the person with the metaphorical motives of the genes. Genes are not puppetmasters; they acted as the recipe for making the brain and body and then they got out of the way.', 'is lying inside a '),

How can a book called evade the responsibility of explaining where sentience comes from? I could, I suppose, invoke the doctrine of logical positivism, which holds that if a statement cannot be verified it is literally meaningless. The imponderables in my list ask about the quintessentially unverifiable. Many thinkers, such as Dennett, conclude that worrying about them is simply flaunting ones confusion: sentient experiences (or, as philosophers call them, qualia) are a cognitive illusion. Once we have isolated the computational and neurological correlates of access-consciousness, there is nothing left to explain. Its just irrational to insist that sentience remains unexplained after all the manifestations of sentience have been accounted for, just because the computations dont have anything sentient in them. Its like insisting that wetness remains unexplained even after all the manifestations of wetness have been accounted for, because moving molecules arent wet. Most people are uncomfortable with the argument, but it is not easy to find anything wrong with it. The philosopher Georges Rey once told me that he has no sentient experiences. He lost them after a bicycle accident when he was fifteen. Since then, he insists, he has been a zombie. I assume he is speaking tongue-in-cheek, but of course I have no way of knowing, and that is his point. The qualia-debunkers do have a point. At least for now, we have no scientific purchase on the special extra ingredient that gives rise to sentience. As far as scientific explanation goes, it might as well not exist. Its not just that claims about sentience are perversely untestable; its that testing them would make no difference to anything anyway. Our incomprehension of sentience does not impede our understanding of how the mind works in the least. Generally', 'just as I do, '),

Mary walked into the bedroom, walked around, and walked out. How do you explain it? Maybe youd say that Mary was looking for something she wanted to find and thought it was in the bedroom. Maybe youd say Mary heard something in the bedroom and wanted to know what made the noise. Or maybe youd say that Mary forgot where she was going; maybe she really intended to go downstairs. But you certainly would not say that Mary just does this every day at this time: she just walks into the bedroom, walks around, and walks out again. It would be unnatural to explain human behavior in the physicists language of time, distance, and mass, and it would also be wrong; if you came back tomorrow to test the hypothesis, it would surely fail. Our minds explain other peoples behavior by their beliefs and desires because other peoples behavior is in fact caused by their beliefs and desires. The behaviorists were wrong, and everyone intuitively knows it. Mental states are invisible and weightless. Philosophers define them as "a relation between a person and a proposition." The relation is an attitude like believes-that, desires-that, hopes-that, pretends-that. The proposition is the content of the belief, something very roughly like the meaning of a sentence for example, Mary finds the keys, or The keys are in the bedroom. The content of a belief lives in a different realm from the facts of the world. There are unicorns grazing in Cambridge Common is false, but John thinks there are unicorns grazing in Cambridge Common could very well be true. To ascribe a belief to someone, we cant just 330 think a thought in the ordinary way, or we wouldnt be able to learn that John believes in unicorns without believing in them ourselves. We have to take a thought, set it aside in mental quotation marks, and think, "That is what John thinks" (or wants, or hopes for, or guesses). Moreover, anything we can think is also something we can think that someone else thinks (Mary knows that John thinks that there are unicorns . . .). These onionlike thoughts-inside-thoughts need a special computational architecture (see Chapter 2) and, when we communicate them to others, the recursive grammar proposed by Chomsky and explained in The Language Instinct. We mortals cant read other peoples minds directly. But we make good guesses from what they say, what we read between the lines, what they show in their face and eyes, and what best explains their behavior. It is our species most remarkable talent. After reading the chapter on vision you might be amazed that people can recognize a dog. Now think about what it takes to recognize the dog in a pantomime of walking one. But somehow children do it. The skills behind mind reading are first exercised in the crib. Two-month-olds stare at eyes; six-month-olds know when theyre staring back; one-year-olds look at what a parent is staring at, and check a parents eyes when they are uncertain why the parent is doing something. Between eighteen and twenty-four months, children begin to separate the contents of other peoples minds from their own beliefs. They show that ability off in a deceptively simple feat: pretending.

Women beat and kill their husbands in self-defense or after years of abuse. Critics of feminism have made much of the occasional statistic that American men are victims of beating and homicide by their spouses almost as often as the women are. But thats not true in the vast majority of communities, and even in the few where it is, the husbands jealousy and intimidation are almost always the cause. Often a morbidly jealous man will imprison his wife in the house and interpret every incoming phone call as proof that she is unfaithful. Women are most at risk when they threaten to leave or do it. The forsaken man may stalk her, hunt her down, and execute her, always with the same rationale: "If I cant have her, no one can." The crime is pointless, but it is the undesired outcome of a paradoxical tactic, a doomsday machine. For every killing of an estranged wife or girlfriend there must be thousands of threats made credible by signs that the man is crazy enough to carry them out regardless of the cost. Many pundits blame violence against women on this or that feature of American society, such as circumcision, war toys, James Bond, or football. But it happens worldwide, including in foraging societies. Among the Yanomamo, a man who suspects his wife of infidelity might slash her with a machete, shoot her with an arrow, hold an ember against her, cut off her ears, or kill her. Even among the idyllic !Kung San of the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa, men batter wives they suspect of being unfaithful. Incidentally, none of these points "condone" the violence or 490 J imply that "its not the mans fault," as it is sometimes claimed. Those non sequiturs could be attached to any explanation, such as the common feminist theory that men are brainwashed by media images that glorify violence against women. All over the world, men also beat and kill cuckolds and suspected cuckolds. Recall that rivalry over women is the leading cause of violence, homicide, and warfare among foraging peoples. As it is written in Proverbs 6:34, "For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance." Unlike birds, though, humans plug their sexual jealousy into a baroque cognitive machine. People think in metaphors, and the metaphor that men have always used for wives is property. In their essay "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Chattel," Wilson and Daly show that men do not merely aim to control their wives and fend off rivals; they assert an entitlement to wives, especially their reproductive capacity, identical to the right of an owner over inanimate property. An owner can sell, exchange, or dispose of his possessions, can modify them without interference, and can demand redress for theft or damage. These rights are recognized by the rest of society and can be enforced by collective. reprisals. In culture after culture, men have deployed the full cognitive apparatus of ownership in conceiving of their relationship to their wives, and until recently they have formalized the metaphor in codes of law. In most societies, marriage is a blatant transfer of ownership of a woman from her father to her husband. In our own marriage ceremony, the father of the bride still "gives her away," but more commonly he sells her. In seventy percent of societies, someone pays when two people get married.

(The man running amok calls to mind a doomsday machine that has been set off.) But though this be madness, yet there is method in it. Precisely these sacrifices of will and reason are effective tactics in the countless bargains, promises, and threats that make up our social relations. The theory stands the Romantic model on its head. The passions are no vestige of an animal past, no wellspring of creativity no enemy of the intellect. The intellect is designed to relinquish control to the passions so that they may serve as guarantors of its offers, promises, and threats against suspicions that they are lowballs, double-crosses, and bluffs. The apparent firewall between passion and reason is not an ineluctable part of the archiHotheads 413 tecture of the brain; it has been programmed in deliberately, because only if the passions are in control can they be credible guarantors. The doomsday-machine theory has been proposed independently by Schelling, Trivers, Daly and Wilson, the economist Jack Hirshleifer, and the economist Robert Frank. Righteous anger, and the attendant thirst for redress or vengeance, is a credible deterrent if it is uncontrollable and unresponsive to the deterrers costs. Such compulsions, though useful in the long run, can drive people to fight far out of proportion to the stakes. In 1982 Argentina annexed the British colony of the Falklands, desolate islands with virtually no economic or strategic importance. In earlier decades it might have made sense for Britain to defend them as an immediate deterrent to anyone with designs on the rest of its empire, but at that point there was no empire left to defend. Frank points out that for what they spent to reclaim the islands, Britain could have given each Falklander a Scottish castle and a lifetime pension. But most Britons were proud that they stood up to the Argentinians. The same sense of fairness makes us sue expensively for small amounts or seek a refund for a defective product despite red tape that costs us more in lost wages than the product was worth. The lust for revenge is a particularly terrifying emotion. All over the world, relatives of the slain fantasize day and night about the bittersweet moment when they might avenge a life with a life and find peace at last. The emotion strikes us as primitive and dreadful because we have contracted the government to settle our scores for us. But in many societies an irresistible thirst for vengeance is ones only protection against deadly raids. Individuals may differ in the resolve with which they will suffer costs to carry out vengeance. Since that resolve is an effective deterrent only if it is advertised, it is accompanied by the emotion traditionally referred to as honor: the desire to publicly avenge even minor trespasses and insults. The hair-trigger of honor and revenge can be tuned to the degree of threat in the environment. Honor and vengeance are raised to godly virtues in societies that lie beyond', 'know sir in the '),

But if you saw the next episode and wanted to know why she plummeted to the bottom of an elevator shaft after she accidentally stepped through the open door, her motives would be irrelevant to anyone but a Freudian gone mad. The explanation is that matter in free fall, Rosalind Shays included, accelerates at a rate of 9.8 meters per second per second. There are many ways to explain an event, and some are better than others. Even if neuroscientists someday decode the entire wiring diagram of the brain, human behavior makes the most sense when it is explained in terms of beliefs and desires, not in terms of volts and grams. Physics provides no insight into the machinations of a crafty lawyer, and even fails to enlighten us about many simpler acts of living things. As Richard Dawkins observed, "If you throw a dead bird into the air it will describe a graceful parabola, exactly as physics books say it should, then come to rest on the ground and stay there. It behaves as a solid body of a particular mass and wind resistance ought to behave. But if you throw a live bird in the air it will not describe a parabola and come to rest on the ground. It will fly away, and may not touch land this side of the county boundary." We understand birds and plants in terms of their innards. To know why they move and grow, we cut them open and put bits under a microscope. We need yet another kind of explanation for artifacts like a chair and a crowbar: a statement of the function the object is intended to perform. It would be silly to try to understand why chairs have a stable horizontal surface by cutting them open and putting bits of them under a microscope. The explanation is that someone designed the chair to hold up a human behind. Many cognitive scientists believe that the mind is equipped with innate intuitive theories or modules for the major ways of making sense Good Ideas 315 of the world. There are modules for objects and forces, for animate beings, for artifacts, for minds, and for natural kinds like animals, plants, and minerals. Dont take the "theory" idiom literally; as we have seen, people dont really work like scientists. Dont take the "module" metaphor too seriously, either; people can mix and match their ways of knowing. A concept like "throwing," for example, welds an intention (intuitive psychology) to a motion (intuitive physics). And we often apply modes of thinking to subject matters they were not designed for, such as in slapstick humor (person as object), animistic religion (tree or mountain as having a mind), and anthropomorphic animal stories (animals with human minds).

The right hemisphere is still active, though, and can carry out simple commands presented in the left visual field, like "Walk" or "Laugh." When the patient (actually, the patients left hemisphere) is asked why he walked out (which we know was a response to the command presented to the right hemisphere), he ingenuously replies, "To get a Coke." When asked why he is laughing, he says, "You guys come up and test us every month. What a way to make a living!" Our confabulations, not coincidentally, present us in the best light. Literally hundreds of experiments in social psychology say so. The humorist Garrison Keillor describes the fictitious community of Lake Wobegon, "where the women are strong, the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average." Indeed, most people claim they are above average in any positive trait you name: leadership, sophistication, athletic prowess, managerial ability, even driving skill. They rationalize the boast by searching for an aspect of the trait that they might in fact be good at. The slow drivers say they are above average in safety, the fast ones that they are above average in reflexes. More generally, we delude ourselves about how benevolent and how effective we are, a combination that social psychologists call beneffectance. When subjects play games that are rigged by the experimenter, they attribute their successes to their own skill and their failures to the luck of the draw. When they are fooled in a fake experiment into thinking they have delivered shocks to another subject, they derogate the victim, implying that he deserved the punishment. Everyone has heard of "reducing cognitive dissonance," in which people invent a new opinion to resolve a contradiction in their minds. For example, a person will recall enjoying a boring task if he had agreed to recommend it to others for paltry pay.

As originally conceived of by the psychologist Leon Festinger, cognitive dissonance is an unsettled feeling that arises from an inconsistency in ones beliefs. Hotheads 423 But thats not right: there is no contradiction between the proposition "The task is boring" and the proposition "I was pressured into lying that the task was fun." Another social psychologist, Eliot Aronson, nailed it down: people doctor their beliefs only to eliminate a contradiction with the proposition "I am nice and in control." Cognitive dissonance is always triggered by blatant evidence that you are not as beneficent and effective as you would like people to think. The urge to reduce it is the urge to get your self-serving story straight. Sometimes we have glimpses of our own self-deception. When does a negative remark sting, cut deep, hit a nerve? When some part of us knows it is true. If every part knew it was true, the remark would not sting; it would be old news. If no part thought it was true, the remark would roll off; we could dismiss it as false. Trivers recounts an experience that is all too familiar (at least to me).

Males invest in their offspring, but fertilization happens out of sight inside the females body, so a male never knows which offspring are his. A female, in contrast, can be certain that any egg or baby coming out of her body carries her genes. A cuckolded male is worse than a celibate one in the evolutionary struggle, and male birds have evolved defenses against it. So have humans. Sexual jealousy is found in all cultures. Both sexes can feel intense jealousy at the thought of a dallying mate, but their emotions are different in two ways. Womens jealousy appears to be under the control of more sophisticated software, and they can appraise their circumstances and determine whether the mans behavior poses a threat to their ultimate interests. Mens jealousy is cruder and more easily triggered. (Once triggered, though, womens jealousy appears to be as intensely felt as mens.) In most societies, some women readily share a husband, but in no society do men readily share a wife. A woman having sex with another man is always a threat to the mans genetic interests, because it might fool him into working for a competitors genes, but a man having sex with another woman is not necessarily a threat to the womans genetic interests, because his illegitimate child is another womans problem. It is only a threat if the man diverts investment from her and her children to the other woman and her children, either temporarily or, in the case of desertion, permanently. So men and women should be jealous of different things. Men should squirm at the thought of their wives or girlfriends having sex with another man; women should squirm at the thought of their husbands or boyfriends giving time, resources, attention, and affection to another woman. Of course no one likes to think of their mate offering sex or affection to anyone else, but even then the reasons may differ: men may be upset about affection because it could lead to sex; women may be upset about sex because it could lead to affection. Buss found that men and women are made as jealous by the thought of alienated sex as by the thought of alienated affection, but when asked to pick their torture, most men said they were more upset by the thought of their partner being sexually unfaithful than emotionally unfaithful, and most women had the opposite reaction. (The same differences are found when men and women imagine their partners being both sexually and emotionally Family Values 489 unfaithful and are asked which aspect of the betrayal bothers them more. That shows that the sex difference is not just a matter of men and women having different expectations of their partners behavior, the men worrying that a woman having sex must also be in love and the women worrying that a man in love must also be having sex.) Buss then pasted electrodes on people and asked them to imagine the two kinds of treachery. The men sweated, frowned, and palpitated more from images of sexual betrayal; the women sweated, frowned, and palpitated more from images of emotional betrayal. (I cited the experiment in Chapter 4 as an illustration of the power of mental images.) Similar results have been found in several countries in Europe and Asia.

A lifelike mechanical lion wouldnt count as the real thing, and one can imagine breeding a striped lion that looked more like a tiger but would still count as a lion. Philosophers say that the meaning of a natural-kind term comes from an intuition of a hidden trait or essence that the members share with one another and with the first examples dubbed with the term. People dont 324 need to know what the essence is, just that there is one. Some people probably think that lionhood is in the blood; others might mumble something about DNA; still others would have no idea but would sense that lions all have it, whatever it is, and pass it to their offspring. Even when an essence is known, it is not a definition. Physicists tell us that gold is matter with atomic number 79, as good an essence as we can hope for. But if they had miscalculated and it turned out that gold was 78 and platinum 79, we would not think that the word gold now refers to platinum or experience much of a change in the way we think about gold. Compare these intuitions with our feelings about artifacts like coffeepots. Coffeepots are pots for making coffee. The possibility that all coffeepots have an essence, that scientists might someday discover it, or that we might have been wrong about coffeepots all along and that they are really pots for making tea are worthy of Monty Pythons Flying Circus. If the driving intuition behind folk physics is the continuous solid object, and the driving intuition behind animacy is an internal and renewable source of oomph, then the driving intuition behind natural kinds is a hidden essence. Folk biology is said to be essentialistic. The essence has something in common with the oomph that powers animals motions, but it also is sensed to give the animal its form, to drive its growth, and to orchestrate its vegetative processes like breathing and digestion. Of course, today we know that this elan vital is really just a tiny data tape and chemical factory inside every cell. Intuitions about essences can be found long ago and far away. Even before Darwin, the Linnaean classification system used by professional biologists was guided by a sense of proper categories based not on similarity but on underlying constitution. Peacocks and peahens were classified as the same animal, as were a caterpillar and the butterfly it turned into. Some similar animals monarch and viceroy butterflies, mice and shrews were put into different groups because of subtle differences in their internal structure or embryonic forms. The classification was hierarchical: every living thing belonged to one species, every species belonged to one genus, and so on up through families, classes, orders, and phyla to the plant and animal kingdoms, all in one tree of life. Again, compare this system with the classification of artifacts say, the tapes in a video store. They can be arranged by genre, such as dramas and musicals, by period, such as new releases and classics, by alphabetical order, by country of origin, or by various cross-classifications such as foreign Good Ideas 325 new releases or classic musicals.

Since hypocrisy is easiest to expose when people compare notes, the search for trustworthiness makes us avid consumers of gossip. In turn, our reputation becomes our most valuable possession, and we are motivated to protect (and inflate) it with conspicuous displays of generosity, sympathy, and integrity and to take umbrage when it is impugned. Are you keeping up? The ability to guard against sham emotions can in turn be used as a weapon against real emotions. One can protect ones own cheating by imputing false motives to someone else by saying that a person really isnt aggrieved, friendly, grateful, guilty, and so on, when she really is.

Is sympathy nothing but a cheap way to buy gratitude? Is niceness just a business tactic? Not at all. Go ahead and think the worst about the sham emotions. But the reason the real ones are felt is not that they are hoped to help the feeler; it is that they in fact helped the feelers ancestors.

The first mutants who felt sympathy and gratitude may have prospered not by their own calculation but because the feelings made it worth their neighbors while to cooperate with them.

As a Cub Scout I was taught how to find the North Star: locate the tip of the handle of the Little Dipper, or extrapolate from the front lip of the Big Dipper a distance seven times its depth. Birds are not born with this knowledge, not because it is unthinkable that it could be innate, but because if it were innate it would soon be obsolete. The earths axis of rotation, and hence the celestial pole (the point in the sky corresponding to north), wobbles in a 27,000-year cycle called the precession of the equinoxes. The cycle is rapid in an evolutionary timetable, and the birds have responded by evolving a special algorithm for learning where the celestial pole is in the night sky. It all happens while they are still in the nest and cannot fly. The nestlings gaze up at the night sky for hours, watching the slow rotation of the constellations. They find the point around which the stars appear to move, and record its position with respect to several nearby constellations, acquiring the information imparted to me by the Cub Scout manual. Months later they can use any of these constellations to maintain a constant heading say, keeping north behind them while flying south, or flying into the celestial pole the next spring to return north. Honeybees perform a dance that tells their hivemates the direction and distance of a food source with respect to the sun. As if that werent impressive enough, the bees have evolved a variety of calibrations and backup systems to deal with the engineering complexities of solar navigation. The dancer uses an internal clock to compensate for the movement of the sun between the time she discovered the source and the time she 182 J passes on the information. If its cloudy, the other bees estimate the direction using the polarization of light in the sky. These feats are the tip of an iceberg of honeybee ingenuity, documented by Karl Von Frisch, James Gould,', 'marine navigation is to '),

But former Representative Patricia Schroeder says she has noticed that a middle-aged congresswoman does not radiate the same animal magnetism to the opposite sex that a middle-aged congressman does. An obvious retort is that women value wealthy and powerful men because it is the men who have the wealth and power. In a sexist society, women have to marry up to get them. That alternative has been tested and refuted. Women with large salaries, postgraduate degrees, prestigious professions, and high self-esteem place a greater value on wealth and status in a husband than other women do. So do the leaders of feminist organizations. Poor men place no higher value on wealth or earning power in a wife than other men do. Among the Bakweri in Cameroon, the women are wealthier and more powerful than the men, and they still insist on men with money. Family Values 483 The humorist Fran Lebowitz once said in an interview, "People who get married because theyre in love make a ridiculous mistake. It makes much more sense to marry your best friend. You like your best friend more than anyone youre ever going to be in love with. You dont choose your best friend because they have a cute nose, but thats all youre doing when you get married; youre saying, I will spend the rest of my life with you because of your lower lip." It is a puzzle, and the obvious place to look for an answer is the fact that you dont make children with your best friend but you do with your spouse. Perhaps we care about a few millimeters of flesh here or there because it is a perceptual signal of a deeper trait that cannot be measured directly: how well equipped the persons body is to serve as the other parent of your children. Fitness as a dam or stud is like any other feature of the world. It is not written on a tag but has to be inferred from appearances, using assumptions about how the world works. Could we really be equipped with an innate eye for beauty? What about the natives in National Geographic who file their teeth, stretch their necks with stacks of rings, burn scars into their cheeks, and put plates in their lips? What about the fat women in the Rubens paintings and Twiggy in the 60s? Dont they show that standards of beauty are arbitrary and vary capriciously? They do not. Who says that everything people do to their bodies is an attempt to look sexy? That is the tacit assumption behind the National Geographic argument, but its obviously false. People decorate their bodies for many reasons: to look rich, to look well connected, to look tough, to look "in," to earn membership in an elite group by enduring a painful initiation. Sexual attractiveness is different. People outside a culture usually agree with the people inside about who is beautiful and who is not, and people everywhere want good-looking partners. Even three-month-old infants prefer to look at a pretty face. What goes into sexiness? Both sexes want a spouse who has developed normally and is free of infection. Not only is a healthy spouse vigorous, noncontagious, and more fertile, but the spouses hereditary resistance to the local parasites will be passed on to the children.

A skillful use of repleteness impresses us not only by evoking a pleaThe Meaning of Life 545 surable feeling through several channels at once. Some of the parts are anomalous at first, and in resolving the anomaly we discover for ourselves the clever ways in which the artist shaped the different parts of the medium to do the same thing at the same time. Why, we ask ourselves, did a howling wind suddenly come up? Why does the lady have a green spot on her cheek? Why is a love song talking about musical keys? In solving the puzzles, the audience is led to pay attention to an ordinarily inconspicuous part of the medium, and the desired effect is reinforced. This insight comes from Arthur Koestlers tour de force on creativity, The Act of Creation, and underlies his ingenious analysis of that other great enigma of human psychology, humor. W H A T  S S O F U N N Y? Here is how Koestler introduces the problem of humor: What is the survival value of the involuntary, simultaneous contraction of fifteen facial muscles associated with certain noises which are often irrepressible? Laughter is a reflex, but unique in that it serves no apparent biological purpose; one might call it a luxury reflex. Its only utilitarian function, as far as one can see, is to provide temporary relief from utilitarian pressures. On the evolutionary level where laughter arises, an element of frivolity seems to creep into a humourless universe governed by the laws of thermodynamics and the survival of the fittest. The paradox can be put in a different way. It strikes us as a reasonable arrangement that a sharp light shone into the eye makes the pupil contract, or that a pin stuck into ones foot causes its instant withdrawal because both the "stimulus" and the "response" are on the same physiological level. But that a complicated mental activity like the reading of a page by Thurber should cause a specific motor response on the reflex level is a lopsided phenomenon which has puzzled philosophers since antiquity. Lets piece together the clues from Koestlers analysis, from more recent ideas of evolutionary psychology, and from actual studies of humor and laughter. Laughter, Koestler noted, is involuntary noisemaking. As any schoolteacher knows, it diverts attention from a speaker and makes it difficult 546 j to continue. And laughter is contagious. The psychologist Robert Provine, who has documented the ethology of laughter in humans, found that people laugh thirty times more often when they are with other people than when they are alone. Even when people laugh alone, they are often imagining they are with others: they are reading others words, hearing their voices on the radio, or watching them on television. People laugh when they hear laughter; that is why television comedies use laugh tracks to compensate for the absence of a live audience. (The rim shot or drumbeat that punctuated the jokes of vaudeville comedians was a precursor.) All this suggests two things. First, laughter is noisy not because it releases pent-up psychic energy but so that others may hear it; it is a form of communication. Second, laughter is involuntary for the same reason that other emotional displays are involuntary (Chapter 6). The brain broadcasts an honest, unfakable, expensive advertisement of a mental state by transferring control from the computational systems underlying', 'mood changes from joy '),

Symbionts give benefits and take them, but neither pays a cost. Roommates with the same taste in music are a kind of symbiotic pair, and each can value the other without an exchange of favors. Once you have made yourself valuable to someone, the person becomes valuable to you. You value him or her because if you were ever in trouble, they would have a stake albeit a selfish stake in getting you out. But now that you value the person, they should value you even more. Not only are you valuable because of your talents or habits, but you are valuable because of your stake in rescuing him or her from hard times. The more you value the person, the more the person values you, Family Values 509 and so on. This runaway process is what we call friendship. If you ask people why they are friends, they are likely to say, "We like the same things, and we know well always be there for each other." Friendship, like other kinds of altruism, is vulnerable to cheaters, and we have a special name for them: fair-weather friends. These sham friends reap the benefits of associating with a valuable person and mimic signs of warmth in an effort to become valued themselves. But when a little rain falls, they are nowhere in sight. People have an emotional response that seems designed to weed out fair-weather friends. When we are neediest, an extended hand is deeply affecting. We are moved, never forget the generosity, and feel compelled to tell the friend we will never forget it. Hard times show you who your real friends are. That is because the point of friendship, in evolutionary terms, is to save you in hard times when its not worth anyone elses trouble. Tooby and Cosmides go on to speculate that the design of our friendship emotions may explain the alienation and loneliness that so many people feel in modern society. Explicit exchanges and turn-taking reciprocation are the kinds of altruism we fall back on when friendship is absent and trust is low. But in modern market economies we trade favors with strangers at unprecedented rates. It may create the perception that we are not deeply engaged with our fellows and are vulnerable to desertion in difficult times. And ironically, the comfortable environment that makes us physically more secure may make us emotionally less secure, because it minimizes the crises that tell us who our real friends are.

Many intellectuals believe that primitive warfare is rare, mild, and ritualized, or at least was so until the noble savages were contaminated by contact with Westerners. But this is romantic nonsense. War has always been hell. Yanomamo villages raid one another endlessly. Seventy percent of all adults over forty have lost a family member to violence.

The example is hypothetical, illustrating how altruism among nonkin what Trivers called reciprocal altruism can evolve. It is easy to confuse the thought experiment with a real observation; Brown remarks, "When I have used the example in teaching, it has sometimes come back to me on exams as a real bird, often as Skinners pigeons, sometimes the black-headed gull, and once the robin." Some species do practice reciprocal altruism, but not many, because it evolves only under special condiHotheads 403 tions. An animal must be able to grant a large benefit to another at a small cost to itself, and the roles must commonly reverse. The animals must devote part of their brains to recognizing each other as individuals (see Chapter 2), and, if repayment comes long after the favor, to remembering who helped them and who refused, and to deciding how to grant and withhold favors accordingly. Humans are, of course, a brainy species, and are zoologically unusual in how often they help unrelated individuals (Chapter 3). Our lifestyles and our minds are particularly adapted to the demands of reciprocal altruism. People have food, tools, help, and information to trade. With language, information is an ideal trade good because its cost to the giver a few seconds of breath is minuscule compared with the benefit to the recipient. Humans are obsessed with individuals; remember the Blick twins from Chapter 2, one of whom bit a police officer but neither of whom could be punished because each benefited from reasonable doubt that he and not his twin did the deed. And the human mind is equipped with goal-setting demons that regulate the doling out of favors; as with kin-directed altruism, reciprocal altruism is behaviorist shorthand for a set of thoughts and emotions. Trivers and the biologist Richard Alexander have shown how the demands of reciprocal altruism are probably the source of many human emotions. Collectively they make up a large part of the moral sense. The minimal equipment is a cheater-detector and a tit-for-tat strategy that begrudges a gross cheater further help. A gross cheater is one who refuses to reciprocate at all, or who returns so little that the altruist gets back less than the cost of the initial favor. Recall from Chapter 5 that Cosmides has shown that people do reason unusually well about cheaters. But the real intrigue begins with Trivers observation that there is a more subtle way to cheat. A subtle cheater reciprocates enough to make it worth the altruists while, but returns less than he is capable of giving, or less than the altruist would give if the situation were reversed. That puts the altruist in an awkward position. In one sense she is being ripped off. But if she insists on equity, the subtle cheater could break off the relationship altogether. Since half a loaf is better than none, the altruist is trapped. She does have one kind of leverage, though. If there are other trading partners in the group who dont cheat at all, or who cheat subtly but less stingily, she can give them her business instead. The game has become more complicated. Selection favors cheating 404 when the altruist will not find out or when she will not break off her altruism if she does find out. That leads to better cheater-detectors, which leads to more subtle cheating, which leads to detectors for more subtle cheating, which leads to tactics to get away with subtle cheating without being detected by the', 'neither indiscriminate groomers nor '),

In the parable, simple operations are easier to perform; in the visual system, simpler descriptions correspond to likelier arrangements in the world. Adelson and Pcntland have brought their parable to life by programming a computer simulation of vision that is designed to interpret scenes with painted polygons much as we do. First, a shape analyzer (a software version of the sheet-metal worker) strives for the most regular shape that duplicates the image. Take the simple shape on the left in this diagram, which people see as a folded sheet, like a book held sideways. 1 The shape specialist tries to assemble a 3-D model of the input shape, shown on the right. When it begins, all it knows is that the corners and edges in the model have to line up with the dots and lines in the image; it does not know how far away they arc in depth. The models vertices are beads sliding on rods (like rays of projection), and the lines between them are infinitely elastic strings. The specialist slides the beads around until it arrives at a shape with the following desiderata. Each polygon making up the shape should be as regular as possible; that is, a polygons angles should not be too different. For example, if the polygon has four sides, the specialist strives for a rectangle. The polygon should be as planar as possible, as if the polygon is filled in with a plastic panel that is hard to bend. And the polygons should be as compact as possible, rather than elongated along the line of sight, as if the plastic panel is also hard to stretch. When the shape specialist is done, it passes on a rigid assembly of while panels to the lighting specialist. The lighting specialist knows the laws that dictate how reflected light depends on the illumination, the lightness of the surface, and the angle of the surface. The specialist is allowed to move a single distant light source around to illuminate the model from various directions. The optimal direction is the one that makes each pair of panels meeting at an edge look as much as possible 254 like their counterparts in the image, requiring as little gray paint as possihle to finish the job. Finally, the reflectance specialist the painter gets the model. It is the specialist of last resort, and its task is to take care of any remaining discrepancy between the image and the model. It finishes the job by proposing different shades of pigmentation for the various surfaces. Does the program work? Adelson and Pentland presented it with a fanfold object and let it rip. The program displays its current guess about the objects shape (first column), its current guess about the direction of the light source (second column), its current guess about where the shadows fall (third column), and its current guess about how the object is painted (fourth column).

Like a friend-of-a-friend legend, that discovery has mutated in the retelling: wings evolved for something else but happened to be perfectly adapted for flight, and one day the insects just decided to fly with them; the evolution of insect wings refutes Darwin because they would have had to evolve gradually and half a wing is useless; the wings of birds were not originally used for locomotion (probably a misremembering of another fact, that the first feathers evolved not for flight but for insulation). All one has to do is say "the evolution of wings" and audiences will nod knowingly, completing the anti-adaptationist argument for themselves. 170 J How can anyone say that any organ was selected for its current function? Maybe it evolved for something else and the animal is only using it for that function now, like the nose holding up spectacles and all that stuff about insect wings that everyone knows about (or was it bird wings?). Here is what you find when you check the facts. Many organs that we see today have maintained their original function. The eye was always an eye, from light-sensitive spot to image-focusing eyeball. Others changed their function. That is not a new discovery. Darwin gave many examples, such as the pectoral fins of fishes becoming the forelimbs of horses, the flippers of whales, the wings of birds, the digging claws of moles, and the arms of humans. In Darwins day the similarities were powerful evidence for the fact of evolution, and they still are. Darwin also cited changes in function to explain the problem of "the incipient stages of useful structures," perennially popular among creationists. How could a complex organ gradually evolve when only the final form is usable? Most often the premise of unusability is just wrong. For example, partial eyes have partial sight, which is better than no sight at all. But sometimes the answer is that before an organ was selected to assume its current form, it was adapted for something else and then went through an intermediate stage in which it accomplished both. The delicate chain of middle-ear bones in mammals (hammer, anvil, stirrup) began as parts of the jaw hinge of reptiles. Reptiles often sense vibrations by lowering their jaws to the ground. Certain bones served both as jaw hinges and as vibration transmitters. That set the stage for the bones to specialize more and more as sound transmitters, causing them to shrink and move into their current shape and role. Darwin called the earlier forms "pre-adaptations," though he stressed that evolution does not somehow anticipate next years model. There is nothing mysterious about the evolution of birds wings. Half a wing will not let you soar like an eagle, but it will let you glide or parachute from trees (as many living animals do), and it will let you leap or take off in bursts while running, like a chicken trying to escape a farmer. Paleontologists disagree about which intermediate stage is best supported by the fossil and aerodynamic evidence, but there is nothing here to give comfort to a creationist or a social scientist. The theory of the evolution of insect wings proposed by Joel Kingsolver and Mimi Koehl, far from being a refutation of adaptationism, is one of its finest moments. Small cold-blooded animals like insects struggle to regulate their temperature. Their high ratio of surface area to volume makes them heat up and cool down quickly.

(277, 101, 3, 'not that babies whatever that would mean. The psychologist Richard Held has a simpler explanation. When infants are born, every neuron in the receiving layer of the visual cortex adds up the inputs from corresponding locations in the two eyes rather than keeping them separate. The brain cant tell which eye a given bit of pattern came from, and simply melts one eyes view on top of the others in a 2-D overlay. Without information about which eye a squiggle came from, stereo vision, convergence, and rivalry are logically impossible, Around the three-month mark each neuron settles on a favorite eye to respond to. The neurons lying one connection downstream can now know when a mark falls on one spot in one eye and on the same spot, or a slightly shifted-over spot, in the other eye the grist for stereo vision. In cats and monkeys, whose brains have been studied directly, this is indeed what happens. As soon as the animals cortex can tell the eyes apart, the animal sees stereograms in depth. That suggests that when the inputs are first tagged "left eye" or "right eye," the circuitry for stereo computation one layer downstream is already installed and functioning. The MinJs Eye 239 In monkeys its all over in two months: by then each neuron has a favorite eye and the baby monkeys see in depth. Compared with other primates, humans are "altricial": babies are born early and helpless, and complete their development outside the womb. Because human infants are born earlier than monkeys in proportion to the length of their childhood, the installation of their binocular circuitry appears at a later age as measured from the date of birth. More generally, when biologists compare the milestones of the maturation of the visual systems of different animals, some born early and helpless, others born late and seeing, they Find that the sequence is pretty much the same whether the later steps take place in the womb or in the world. The emergence of the crucial left-eye and right-eye neurons can be disrupted by experience. When the neurobiologists David Hubel and Torsten Wriesel raised kittens and baby monkeys with one eye covered, the input neurons of the cortex all tuned themselves to the other eye, making the animal functionally blind in the eye that was covered. The damage was permanent, even with only brief deprivation, if the eye was covered in a critical period in the animals development. In monkeys, the visual system is especially vulnerable during the first two weeks of life, and the vulnerability tapers off during the first year. Covering the eye of an adult monkey, even for four years, does no harm. At first this all looked like a case of "use it or lose it," but a surprise was in store. When Hubel and Wiesel covered both eyes, the brain did not show twice the damage; half the cells showed no damage at all. The havoc in the single-eyepatch experiment came about not because a neuron destined for the covered eye was starved of input hut because the input signals from the uncovered eye elbowed the covered eyes inputs out of the way. The eyes compete for real estate in the input layer of the cortex. Each neuron begins with a slight bias for one eye or the other, and the input from that eye exaggerates the bias until the neuron responds to it alone. The inputs do not even have to originate in the world; waves of activation from intermediate way-stations, a kind of internally generated test pattern,', 'not that babies whatever '),

The investment decisions are not conscious forecasts of the number of grandchildren expected from each child, but emotional responses that were tuned by natural selection to have outcomes that maximized that number in the environment in which we evolved. Though enlightened parents try mightily never to play favorites, they dont always succeed. In one study, fully two-thirds of British and American mothers confessed to loving one of their children more. How do parents make Sophies Choice and sacrifice a child when circumstances demand it? Evolutionary theory predicts that the main criterion should be age. Childhood is a minefield, and the older a child gets, the luckier a parent is to have it alive and the more irreplaceable the child is as an expected source of grandchildren, right up until sexual maturity. (From then on, the reproductive years begin to be used up and the childs expected number of offspring declines.) For example, the actuarial tables show that a four-year-old in a foraging society will, on average, give a parent 1.4 times as many grandchildren as a newborn, an eight-year-old 1.5 times as many, and a twelve-year-old 1.7 times as many. So if parents already have a child when an infant arrives and cannot feed them both, they should sacrifice the infant. In no human society do parents sacrifice an older child when a younger one is born. In our society, the chance that a parent will kill a child drops steadily with the childs age, especially during the vulnerable first year. When parents are asked to imagine the loss of a child, they say they would grieve more for older children, up until the teenage years. The rise and fall of anticipated Family Values 453 grief correlates almost perfectly with the life expectancies of huntergatherer children. On the other hand, a younger child, being more helpless, has more use for a parents daily ministrations. Parents report more tender feelings for their younger offspring, even though they seem to value the older ones more. The calculations begin to change when parents get older and a new child is likely to be their last one. There is nothing to save for, and the baby of the family is likely to be indulged. Parents also favor children that one might call, in a cold-hearted way, better investments: more vigorous, better looking, more talented. Given that parents are apt to play favorites, offspring should be selected to manipulate their parents investment decisions in their favor. Children are exquisitely sensitive to favoritism, right through adulthood and after the parents deaths. They should calculate how to make the best of the hand that nature dealt them and of the dynamics of the poker game they were born into. The historian Frank Sulloway has argued that the elusive nongenetic component of personality is a set of strategies to compete with siblings for parental investment, and that is why children in the same family are so different. Each child develops in a different family ecology and forms a different plan for getting out of childhood alive. (The idea is an alternative to Harris proposal that personality is a strategy for coping in peer groups, though both could be right.) A first-born child has been spotted several advantages. The first-born, merely by having survived to its present age, is more precious to the parents, and of course is bigger, stronger, and wiser and will be so for as long', 'not want to invest '),

When a feature is noteworthy cats have claws, bees have stingers we file it away as an explicit statement in our conceptual database, available later for instant lookup. But when it is not, we call up a memory of the appearance of the object and run our shape analyzers over the image. Checking for previously unnoticed geometric properties of absent objects is one of the main functions of imagery, and Kosslyn has shown that this mental process differs from dredging up explicit facts. When he asked people questions about well-rehearsed facts, like whether a cat has claws or a lobster has a tail, the speed of the answer depended on how strongly the object and its part were associated in memory. People must have retrieved the answer from a mental database. But when the questions were more unusual, like whether a cat has a head or a lobster has a mouth, and people consulted a mental image, the speed of the answer depended on the size of the part; smaller parts were slower to verify. Since size and shape are mixed together in an image, smaller shape details are harder to resolve. For decades, philosophers have suggested that the perfect test of whether mental images are depictions or descriptions was whether people can reinterpret ambiguous shapes, like the duck-rabbit: The Minds Eye 293 If the mind stores only descriptions, then a person who sees the duckrabbit as a rabbit should tuck away only the label "rabbit." Nothing in the label captures anything about ducks, so later on, the rabbit-seers should be at a loss when asked whether some other animal lurked in the shape; the ambiguous geometric information has been sloughed off. But if the mind stores images, the geometry is still available, and people should be able to call back the image and inspect it for new interpretations. The duck-rabbit itself turns out to be a hard case, because people store shapes with a front-back frame of reference attached, and reinterpreting the duck-rabbit requires reversing the frame. But with some gentle nudging (such as encouraging people to concentrate on the curve at the back of the head), many people do see the duck in the rabbit image or vice versa. Almost everyone can flip simpler ambiguous images. The psychologist Ronald Finke, Martha Farah, and I got people to reinterpret images from verbal descriptions alone, which we read aloud while their eyes were closed. What object can you "see" in each of these descriptions? Imagine the letter D. Rotate it 90 degrees to the right. Put the number 4 above it. Now remove the horizontal segment of the 4 to the right of the vertical line. Imagine the letter B. Rotate it 90 degrees to the left. Put a triangle directly below it having the same width and pointing down. Remove the horizontal line. Imagine the letter K. Place a square next to it on the left side. Put a circle inside the square. Now rotate the figure 90 degrees to the left.

This chapter explores how vision turns retinal depictions into mental descriptions.

How do they work, and why, for some people, dont they work? Despite all the posters, books, and jigsaw puzzles, I have not seen a single attempt at explaining them to the millions of curious consumers. Understanding stereograms is not only a good way to grasp the workings of perception but it is also a treat for the intellect. Stereograms are yet another example of the marvelous contrivances of natural selection, this one inside our own heads. Autostereograms exploit not one but four discoveries on how to trick the eye. The first, strange to say, is the picture. We are so jaded; by photographs, drawings, television, and movies that we forget that they are a The Minds Eye \ 215 benign illusion. Smears of ink or flickering phosphor dots can make us laugh, cry, even become sexually aroused. Humans have made pictures for at least thirty thousand years, and contrary to some social-science folklore, the ability to see them as depictions is universal. The psychologist Paul Ekman created a furor in anthropology by showing that isolated New Guinean highlanders could recognize the facial expressions in photographs of Berkeley students. (Emotions, like everything else, were thought to be culturally relative.) Lost in the brouhaha was a more basic discovery: that the New Guineans were seeing things in the photographs at all rather than treating them as blotchy gray paper. The picture exploits projection, the optical law that makes perception such a hard problem. Vision begins when a photon (unit of light energy) is reflected off a surface and zips along a line through the pupil to stimulate one of the photoreceptors (rods and cones) lining the curved inner surface of the eyeball. The receptor passes a neural signal up to the brain, and the brains first task is to figure out where in the world that photon came from. Unfortunately, the ray defining the photons path extends out to infinity, and all the brain knows is that the originating patch lies somewhere along the ray. For all the brain knows, it could be a foot away, a mile away, or many light-years away; information about the third dimension, distance from the eye, has been lost in the process of projection. The ambiguity is multiplied combinatorially by the million other receptors in the retina, each fundamentally confused about how far away its stimulating patch lies. Any retinal image, then, could have been produced by an infinite number of arrangements of three-dimensional surfaces in the world (see the diagram on p. 9). Of course, we dont perceive infinite possibilities; we home in on one, generally close to the correct one. And here is an opening for a crafter of', 'object that gave rise '),

A baby could experience the blooming and buzzing all its life unless it was equipped with a mental mechanism that interpreted the blooms and buzzes as the outward signs Good Ideas 317 of persisting objects that follow mechanical laws. We should expect infants to show some appreciation of physics from the start. Only careful laboratory studies can tell us what it is like rather, what it was like to be a baby. Unfortunately, infants are difficult experimental subjects, worse than rats and sophomores. They cant easily be conditioned, and they dont talk. But an ingenious technique, refined by the psychologists Elizabeth Spelke and Renee Baillargeon, capitalizes on one feat that infants are good at: getting bored. When infants see the same old thing again and again, they signal their boredom by looking away. If a new thing appears, they perk up and stare. Now, "old thing" and "new thing" are in the mind of the beholder. By seeing what revives babies interest and what prolongs their ennui, we can guess at what things they see as the same and what things they see as different that is, how they categorize experience. Its especially informative when a screen first blocks part of the infants view and then falls away, for we can try to tell what the babies were thinking about the invisible part of their world. If the babys eyes are only momentarily attracted and then wander off, we can infer that the scene was in the babys minds eye all along. If the baby stares longer, we can infer that the scene came as a surprise. Three- to four-month-old infants are usually the youngest tested, both because they are better behaved than younger babies and because their stereo vision, motion perception, visual attention, and acuity have just matured. The tests cannot, by themselves, establish what is and is not innate. Three-month-olds were not born yesterday, so anything they know they could, in theory, have learned. And three-month-olds still have a lot of maturing to do, so anything they come to know later could emerge without learning, just as teeth and pubic hair do. But by telling us what babies know at what age, the findings narrow the options. Spelke and Philip Kelman wanted to see what infants treated as an object. Remember from Chapter 4 that it is not easy, even for an adult, to say what an "object" is. An object can be defined as a stretch of the visual field with a smooth silhouette, a stretch with a homogeneous color and texture, or a collection of patches with a common motion. Often these definitions pick out the same pieces, but when they dont, it is common motion that wins the day. When pieces move together, we see them as a single object; when pieces go their separate ways, we see them as separate objects. The concept of an object is useful because bits of matter that are attached to one another usually move together. Bicycles and 318 I grapevines and snails may be jagged agglomerations of different materials, but if you pick up one end, the other end comes along for the ride. Kelman and Spelke bored babies with two sticks poking out from behind the top and bottom edges of a wide screen. The question was whether the babies would see the sticks as part of a single object. When the screen was removed, the babies saw either one long stick or two short ones with a gap between them. If the', 'objects do not exist '),

Unless they send out their mvn white light from a flash, they render an indoor scene with a thick rusty cast, a shady scene as pasty blue, and so on. A knowledgeable photographer can buy special film or screw a filter on the lens to compensate, and a good lab technician can correct the color when printing the photograph, but an instant camera obviously cannot. So Land had a practical interest in how to remove the intensity and color of the illumination, a problem called color constancy. But he was also a self-taught, ingenious perception scientist, curious about how the brain solves the problem. He set up a color perception lab and developed a clever theory of color constancy. His idea, called the Retinex theory, gave the perceiver several assumptions. One is that earthly illumination is a rich mixture of wavelengths, (The exception that proves the rule is the sodium vapor lamp, the energy-saving fixture found in parking lots. It sends out a narrow range of wavelengths which our perception system cant factor out; cars and faces are dyed a ghastly yellow.) The second assumption is that gradual changes in brightness and color across the visual field probably come from the way the scene is illuminated, whereas abrupt transitions probably come from the boundary where one object ends and another begins. To keep things simple, he tested people and his model on artificial worlds composed of 2-D rectangular patches, which he called Mondrians, after the Dutch painter. In a Mondrian lit from the side, a yeilow patch at one edge can reflect very different light from the same yellow patch at the other. But people see chem both as yellow, and the Betinex model, which removes the lighting gradient from edge to edge, does too. The Retinex theory was a good start, hut it turned out to be too simple, One problem is the assumption that the world is a Mondrian, a big flat plane. Go back to Adelson s drawings on page 242, which are zigzag Mondrians. The Retinex model treats all sharp boundaries alike, interpreting Edge I in the left drawing like Edge 1 in the right drawing. But to you, the left one looks like a border between stripes of different colors, and the right one looks like a single stripe that is folded and partly in shade. The difference comes from your interpretation of 3-D shape. Your shape analyzer has bent the Mondrians into striped room dividers, but 248 the Retinex model sees them as the same old checkerboard. Obviously, it is missing something. That something is the effect of slant on shading, the third taw that turns a scene into an image. A surface facing a light source head-on reflects back a lot of light, because the light smacks into the surface and rebounds right back, A surface angled almost parallel to the source reflects much less, because most of the light grazes off it and continues on its way. If you are positioned near the light source, your eye picks up more light when the surface faces you than when it faces almost sideways. You may be able to see the difference by shining a flashlight at a piece of gray cardboard and tilting the cardboard. How might our shading analyzer run the law backwards and figure out how a surface is slanted based on how much light it reflects? The benefits go beyond estimating the', 'of the illumination just '),

The so-called rational animal has a desperate drive to pair up and writhe and moan. And as Isak Dinesen wrote, "What is man, when you come to think upon him, but a minutely set, ingenious machine for turning, with infinite artfulness, the red wine of Shiraz into urine?" But oddly enough, humor is also a prized tactic of rhetoric and intellectual argument. Wit can be a fearsome rapier in the hands of a skilled polemicist. Ronald Reagans popularity and effectiveness as president owed much to his facility with one-liners that quashed debate and criticism, at least for the moment; for example, when deflecting questions about abortion rights he would say, "I notice that everyone in favor of abortion has already been born." Philosophers relish the true story of the theoretician who announced at a scholarly conference that while some languages use a double negative to convey an affirmative, no language uses a double affirmative to convey a negative. A philosopher standing at the back of the hall shouted in a singsong, "Yeah, yeah." Though it may be true, as Voltaire wrote, that "a witty saying proves nothing," Voltaire was famously not above using them himself. The perfect quip can give a speaker an instant victory, deserved or not, and leave opponents stammering. We often feel that a clever aphorism captures a truth that would require pages to defend in any other way. And here we get to Koestlers attempt to reverse-engineer humor. Koestler was an early appreciator of cognitive science at a time when behaviorism ruled, and he called attention to the minds inventory of rule systems, modes of construal, ways of thinking, or frames of reference. Humor, he said, begins with a train of thought in one frame of reference that bumps up against an anomaly: an event or statement that makes no sense in the context of what has come before. The anomaly can be resolved by shifting to a different frame of reference, one in which the event does makes sense. And within that frame, someones dignity has been downgraded. He calls the shift "bisociation." Koestlers examples of humor have not aged well, so Ill illustrate the theory with a few that amuse me, at the cost of killing the jokes by explaining them. 550 J Lady Astor said to Winston Churchill, "If you were my husband, Id put poison in your tea." He replied, "If you were my wife, Id drink it." The response is anomalous in the frame of reference of murder, because people resist being murdered. The anomaly is resolved by switching to the frame of reference of suicide, in which death is welcomed as an escape from misery. In that frame Lady Astor is the cause of marital misery, an ignominious role. A mountain climber slips over a precipice and clings to a rope over a thousand-foot drop. In fear and despair, he looks to the heavens and cries, "Is there anyone up there who can help me?" A voice from above booms, "You will be saved if you show your faith by letting go of the rope." The man looks down, then up, and shouts, "Is there anyone else up there who can help me?" The response is incongruous in the frame of reference of religious stories, in which God grants miracles in return for signs of faith and people are grateful for the bargain. It is resolved by slipping into the frame of day-to-day life, in which people have a healthy', 'or Rabelaisian Sex The '),
(284, 108, 3, 'other has to be on the left. The contrast between a proposition and an array is stark. Propositions can represent cats without grins, grins without cats, or any other disembodied abstraction: squares of no particular size, symmetry with no particular shape, attachment with no particular place, and so on. That is the beauty of a proposition: it is an austere statement of some abstract fact, uncluttered with irrelevant details. Spatial arrays, because they consist only of filled and unfilled patches, commit one to a concrete arrangement of matter in space. And so do mental images: forming an image of "symmetry," without imagining a something or other that is symmetrical, cant be done. The concreteness of mental images allows them to be co-opted as a handy analogue computer. Amy is richer than Abigail; Alicia is not as rich as Abigail; whos the richest? Many people solve these syllogisms by lining up the characters in a mental image from least rich to richest. Why should this work? The medium underlying imagery comes with cells dedicated to each location, fixed in a two-dimensional arrangement. That supplies many truths of geometry for free. For example, left-to-right arrangement in space is transitive: if A is to the left of B, and B is to the left of C, then A is to the left of C. Any lookup mechanism that finds the locations of shapes in the array will automatically respect transitivity; the architecture of the medium leaves it no choice. Suppose the reasoning centers of the brain can get their hands on the mechanisms that plop shapes into the array and that read their locations out of it. Those reasoning demons can exploit the geometry of the array as a surrogate for keeping certain logical constraints in mind. Wealth, like location on a line, is transitive: if A is richer than B, and B is richer than C, then A is richer than C. By using location in an image to symbolize wealth, the thinker takes advantage of the transitivity of location built into the array, and does not have to enter it into a chain of deductive steps. The problem becomes a matter of plop down and look up. It is a fine example of how the form of a mental representation determines what is easy or hard to think. Mental images also resemble arrays in shmooshing together size, shape, location, and orientation into one pattern of contours, rather 292 than neatly factoring them into separate assertions. Mental rotation is a good example. In assessing an objects shape, a person cannot ignore its orientation which would be a simple matter if orientation were sequestered in its own statement. Instead, the person must nudge the orientation gradually and watch as the shape changes. The orientation is not re-computed in one step like a matrix multiplication in a digital computer; the farther a shape is dialed, the longer the dialings takes. There must be a rotator network overlaid on the array that shifts the contents of cells a few degrees around its center. Larger rotations require iterating the rotator, bucket-brigade style. Experiments on how people solve spatial problems have uncovered a well-stocked mental toolbox of graphic operations, such as zooming, shrinking, panning, scanning, tracing, and coloring. Visual thinking, such as judging whether two objects lie along the same line or whether two blobs of different sizes have the same shape, strings these operations into mental animation sequences. Finally, images capture the geometry of an object, not just its meaning. The surefire way of getting people to experience imagery is to ask them about obscure details of', 'other has to be '),
(285, 109, 3, 'Our knowledge of restaurant menus tells us that the or in free beer or coffee implies "not Good Ideas 335 both" you get only one of them free; if you want the other, you have to pay for it. Farther along, we learn that John chose coffee. From the premises "not both free beer and free coffee" and "free coffee," we derive "not free beer" by a logical inference. The answer to question (b) is also no. Our knowledge of restaurants reminds us that food and beverages are not free unless explicitly offered as such by the menu. We therefore add the conditional "if not steak, then no free red wine." John chose the soup and salad, which suggests he did not choose steak; we conclude, using a logical inference, that he did not get a free glass of wine. Logic is indispensable in inferring true things about the world from piecemeal facts acquired from other people via language or from ones own generalizations. Why, then, do people seem to flout logic in stories about archeologists, biologists, and chess players? One reason is that logical words in everyday languages like English are ambiguous, often denoting several formal logical concepts. The English word or can sometimes mean the logical connective OR (A or B or both) and can sometimes mean the logical connective XOR (exclusive or: A or B but not both). The context often makes it clear which one the speaker intended, but in bare puzzles coming out of the blue, readers can make the wrong guess. Another reason is that logical inferences cannot be drawn out willynilly. Any true statement can spawn an infinite number of true but useless new ones. From "Iowa grows soybeans," we can derive "Iowa grows soybeans or the cow jumped over the moon," "Iowa grows soybeans and either the cow jumped over the moon or it didnt," ad infinitum. (This is an example of the "frame problem" introduced in Chapter 1.) Unless it has all the time in the world, even the best logical inferencer has to guess which implications to explore and which are likely to be blind alleys. Some rules have to be inhibited, so valid inferences will inevitably be missed. The guessing cant itself come from logic; generally it comes from assuming that the speaker is a cooperative conversational partner conveying relevant information and not, say, a hostile lawyer or a toughgrading logic professor trying to trip one up. Perhaps the most important impediment is that mental logic is not a hand-held calculator ready to accept any As and Bs and Cs as input. It is enmeshed with our system of knowledge about the world. A particular step of mental logic, once set into motion, does not depend on world knowledge, but its inputs and outputs are piped directly into that knowl336 edge. In the restaurant story, for example, the links of inference alternate between knowledge of menus and applications of logic. Some areas of knowledge have their own inference rules that can either reinforce or work at cross-purposes with the rules of logic. A famous example comes from the psychologist Peter Wason. Wason was inspired by the philosopher Karl Poppers ideal of scientific reasoning: a hypothesis is accepted if attempts to falsify it fail. Wason wanted to see how ordinary people do at falsifying hypotheses. He told them that a set of cards had letters on one side and numbers on the other, and asked them to test the rule "If a card has a D on one side, it has a 3 on the other," a simple P-implies-Q', 'Our knowledge of restaurant '),

Natural selection may not have had complete freedom to reprogram. the emotions, but it had a lot. And the human cerebral cortex does not ride piggyback on an ancient limbic system, or serve as the terminus of a processing stream beginning there. The systems work in tandem, integrated by many two-way connections. The amygdala, an almond-shaped organ buried in each temporal lobe, houses the main circuits that color our experience with emotions. It receives not just simple signals (such as of loud noises) from the lower stations of the brain, but abstract, complex information from the brains 372 I highest centers. The amygdala in turn sends signals to virtually every other part of the brain, including the decision-making circuitry of the frontal lobes. The anatomy mirrors the psychology. Emotion is not just running away from a bear. It can be set off by the most sophisticated information processing the mind is capable of, such as reading a Dear John letter or coming home to find an ambulance in the driveway. And the emotions help to connive intricate plots for escape, revenge, ambition, and courtship.

I he first step in reverse-engineering the emotions is try to imagine what a mind would be like without them.

But Spocks emotionlessness really just amounted to his being in control, not losing his head, coolly voicing unpleasant truths, and so on. He must have been driven by some motives or goals. Something must have kept Spock from spending his days calculating pi to a quadrillion digits or memorizing the Manhattan telephone directory. Something must have impelled him to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new civilizations, and to boldly go where no man had gone before.

Presumably a part of his brain quickly mobilized his faculties to scope out how to flee and to take steps to avoid the vulnerable predicament in the future. That is, he had fear. Spock may not have been impulsive or demonstrative, but he must have had drives that impelled him to deploy his intellect in pursuit of certain goals rather than others. A conventional computer program is a list of instructions that the machine executes until it reaches STOP. But the intelligence of aliens, robots, and animals needs a more flexible method of control. Recall that intelligence is the pursuit of goals in the face of obstacles. Without goals, the very concept of intelligence is meaningless.

To reconstruct human evolution, we need physical anthropology to find the bones, archeology to understand the tools, molecular biology to date the split from chimpanzees, and paleobotany to reconstruct the environment from fossil pollen.

But in the study of the mind, sentience floats in its own plane, high above the causal chains of psychology and neuroscience. If we ever could trace all the neurocomputational steps from perception through reasoning and emotion to 148 J behavior, the only thing left missing by the lack of a theory of sentience would be an understanding of sentience itself. But saying that we have no scientific explanation of sentience is not the same as saying that sentience does not exist at all. I am as certain that I am sentient as I am certain of anything, and I bet you feel the same. Though I concede that my curiosity about sentience may never be satisfied, I refuse to believe that I am just confused when I think I am sentient at all! (Dennetts analogy of unexplained wetness is not decisive: wetness is itself a subjective feeling, so the observers dissatisfaction is just the problem of sentience all over again.)

The so-called neutral passage, which had been chosen by the female investigators, described a man and a woman chatting about the relative merits of an anthropology major over pre-med. The men found it highly erotic! Women can sometimes be aroused when they have agreed to watch portrayals of intercourse, but they do not seek them out. (Symons points out that women are more choosy than men in consenting to sex, but once they have consented, there is no reason to believe they are any less responsive to sexual stimulation.) The closest Family Values 473 mass-market equivalents to pornography for women are the romance novel and the bodice-ripper, in which the sex is described in the context of emotions and relationships rather than as a succession of bumping bodies. The desire for sexual variety is an unusual adaptation, for it is insatiable. Most commodities of fitness show diminishing returns or an optimal level. People do not seek mass quantities of air, food, and water, and they want to be not too hot and not too cold but just right. But the more women a man has sex with, the more offspring he leaves; too much is never enough. That gives men a limitless appetite for casual sex partners (and perhaps for the commodities that in ancestral environments would have led to multiple partners, such as power and wealth). Everyday life offers most men few opportunities to plumb the bottom of the desire, but occasionally a man is rich, famous, handsome, and amoral enough to try. Georges Simenon and Hugh Hefner claimed to have had thousands of partners; Wilt Chamberlain estimated that he had twenty thousand. Say we liberally adjust for braggadocio and assume that Chamberlain inflated his estimate by a factor of, say, ten. That would still mean that one thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine sex partners were not enough. Symons notes that homosexual relations offer a clear window on the desires of each sex. Every heterosexual relationship is a compromise between the wants of a man and the wants of a woman, so differences between the sexes tend to be minimized. But homosexuals do not have to compromise, and their sex lives showcase human sexuality in purer form (at least insofar as the rest of their sexual brains are not patterned like those of the opposite sex). In a study of homosexuals in San Francisco before the AIDS epidemic, twenty-eight percent of gay men reported having had more than a thousand sex partners, and seventy-five percent reported having had more than a hundred. No gay woman reported a thousand partners, and only two percent reported as many as a hundred. Other desires of gay men, like pornography, prostitutes, and attractive young partners, also mirror or exaggerate the desires of heterosexual men. (Incidentally, the fact that mens sexual wants are the same whether they are directed at women or directed at other men refutes the 474 J . theory that they are instruments for oppressing women.) Its not that gay men are oversexed; they are simply men whose male desires bounce off other male desires rather than off female desires. Symons writes, "I am suggesting that heterosexual men would be as likely as homosexual men to have sex most often with strangers, to participate in anonymous orgies in public baths, and to stop off in public restrooms for five minutes of fellatio on the way home from work if women were interested in these activities. But women are not interested." Among heterosexuals, if men want variety more than women', 'passage in the control '),

Tarr and I glumly wrote up a paper begging the reader to believe that people use a different strategy to recognize mirror images. (In psychology, invoking "strategies" to explain funny data is the last refuge of the clueless.) But just as we were touching up the final draft for publication, an idea hit. We remembered a theorem of the geometry of motion: a 2-D shape can always be aligned with its mirror image by a rotation of no more than 180 degrees, as long as the rotation can be in the third dimension around an optimal axis. In principle, any of our mirror-reversed shapes could be flipped in depth to match the standard upright shape, and the flip would take the same amount of time. The mirror image at 0 degrees would simply swivel around a vertical axis like a revolving door. The upside-down shape at 180 degrees could turn like a chicken on a rotisserie. The sideways shape could pivot around a diagonal axis, like this: look at the back of your right hand, fingertips up; now look at your palm, fingertips left. Different tilted axes could serve as the hinge for the other misoriented shapes; in every case, the rotation would be exactly 180 degrees. It would fit the data perfectly: people may have been mentally rotating all the shapes but were optimal rotators, dialing the standard shapes in the picture plane and flipping the mirror-reversed shapes in depth around the best axis. We could scarcely believe it. Could people have found the optimal axis before even knowing what the shape was? We knew it was mathematically possible: by identifying just three non-collinear landmarks in each of two views of a shape, one can calculate the axis of rotation that would align one with the other. But can people really do this calculation? We convinced ourselves with a bit of computer animation. Roger Shepard once showed that if people see a shape alternating with a tilted copy, they see it rock back and forth. So we showed ourselves the standard upright shape alternating with one of its mirror images, back and forth The Minds Eye 283 once a second. The perception of flipping was so obvious that we didnt bother to recruit volunteers to confirm it. When the shape alternated with its upright reflection, it seemed to pivot like a washing machine agitator. When it alternated with its upside-down reflection, it did backflips. When it alternated with its sideways reflection, it swooped back and forth around a diagonal axis, and so on. The brain finds the axis every time. The subjects in our experiment were smarter than we were. The clincher came from Tarrs thesis. He had replicated our experiments using three-dimensional shapes and their mirror images, rotated in the picture plane (shown below) and in depth: 0° 45° 90° 135° 180° Everything came out the same as for the 2-D shapes, except what people did with the mirror images. Just as a misoriented 2-D shape can be matched to the standard orientation by a rotation in the 2-D picture plane, and its mirror image can be rotated to the standard orientation by a 180-degree flip in the third dimension, a misoriented 3-D shape (top row) can be rotated to the standard orientation in 3-D space, and its mirror image (bottom row) can be rotated to the standard by a 180-degree flip in the fourth dimension.

All these monocular cues to depth allow people who are blind in one eye to get around pretty well, including the aviator Wiley Post and a wide receiver for the New York Giants football team in the 1970s. The brain is an opportunistic and mathematically adroit consumer of information, and perhaps that is why its use of one cue, binocular disparity, eluded scientists for so long. Wheatstone proved that the mind turns trigonometry into consciousness when he designed the first fully three-dimensional picture, the stereogram. The idea is simple. Capture a scene using two of Leonardos windows, or, more practically, two cameras, each positioned where one eye would be. Place the right picture in front of a persons right eye and the left picture in front of his left eye. If the brain assumes that the two eyes look at one three-dimensional world, with differences in the views coming from binocular parallax, it should be fooled by the pictures and combine them into a cyclopean image in which objects appear at different depths. left eyes picture right eyes picture The Minds Eye 221 But here Wheatstone ran into a problem, one that still challenges all stereoscopic gadgets. The brain physically adjusts the eyes to the depth of a surface in two ways. First, though I have been describing the pupil as if it were a pinhole, in fact it has a lens to accumulate many rays of light emanating from a point in the world and to focus them all at a point on the retina. The closer the object, the more the rays have to be bent for them to converge to a point rather than to a blurry disk, and the fatter the lens of the eye has to be. Muscles inside the eyeball have to thicken the lens to focus nearby objects and flatten it to focus distant objects. near object needs fat lens far object needs skinny lens The squeezing is controlled by the focusing reflex, a feedback loop that adjusts the shape of the lens until the fine detail on the retina is at a maximum. (The circuit is similar to the one used in some autofocus cameras.) Poorly focused movies are annoying to watch because the brain keeps trying to eliminate the blur by accommodating the lens, a futile gesture. The second physical adjustment is to aim the two eyes, which are about two and a half inches apart, at the same spot in the world. The closer the object, the more the eyes must be crossed. near object needs highly crossed eyes far object needs less crossed eyes 222 The eyes are crossed and uncrossed by muscles attached to their sides; the muscles are controlled by a brain circuit that tries to eliminate double images. (Seeing double is often a sign that the brain has been poisoned, suffocated, or bruised.) The circuit is similar to the rangefinders in old cameras, in which a prism superimposes the views from two viewfinder windows and the photographer angles the prism (which is geared to the camera lens) until the images line up. The brain uses the rangefinder', 'point changes continuously, making '),

The trick in aerial reconnaissance is to photograph the land, let the plane fly a bit, and photograph it again. The pictures are placed side by side and then fed into a hypersensitive detector of disparity in two images: a human being. A person literally looks at the photographs with a stereo viewer, as if he were a giant peering down from the sky with one eye at each position from which the airplane took a picture, and the camouflaged objects pop out in depth. Since a camouflaged object, by definition, is near-invisible in a single view, we have another example of the cyclopean eye seeing what neither real eye can see. The proof had to come from perfect camouflage, and here Jules/, went to the computer. For the left eyes view, he had the computer make a square covered with random dots, like television snow. Julesz then had 230 the computer make a copy for the right eye, but with one twist: he shifted a patch of dots a bit over to the left, and inserted a new stripe of random dots into the gap at the right so the shifted patch would be perfectly camouflaged. Each picture on its own looked like pepper. But when put in the stereoscope, the patch levitated into the air. H I 1 r /M/ Many authorities on stereo vision at the time refused to believe it because the correspondence problem the brain had to solve was just too hard. They suspected that Julesz had somehow left little cut marks behind in one of the pictures. But of course the computer did :no such thing. Anyone who sees a random-dot stereogram is immediatiely convinced. All it took for Julesz occasional collaborator, Christopher Tyler, to invent the magic-eye autostereogram was to combine the wallpaper autostereogram with the random-dot stereogram. The computer generates a vertical stripe of dots and lays copies of it side by side, creating random-dot wallpaper. Say each stripe is ten dots wide, and woinumber the dots from 1 to 10 (using "0" for 10): spaces. When the eyes fixate on neighboring stripes, they falsely fuse, just as they do with a wallpaper stereogram, except that the brain is superimposing stretches of random dots rather than flowers. Remember that in a wallpaper stereogram, copies of a pattern that have been squashed closer together will float above the rest because their lines of sight cross closer to the viewer. To make a patch float out of a rrtagic-eye CL. repeat themselves every eleven spaces. (The stuffed rows, you will notice, are longer than the rest.) Copies that are more widely spaced equals a surface that is more distant. A real random-dot autostereogram, of course, is made of dots, not numbers, so you dont notice the snippedout or stuffed-in material, and the uneven lines are filled out with extra dots. Here is an example. The fun in viewing a real random-dot autostereogram is that the moment of pop-out surprises the viewer with previously invisible shapes: When the autostereogram craze hit Japan, it soon developed into an art form. Dots are not necessary; any tapestry of small contours rich enough to fool the brain into locking the eyes on neighboring stripes will do. The first commercial autostereograms used colored squiggles, and the Japanese ones use flowers, ocean waves, and, taking a leaf out of Ames book, leaves. Thanks to the computer, the shapes dont have to be flat cutouts like in a diorama.', 'positions in the two '),
(293, 117, 3, 'problems make one long for a scale model in the head, but that isnt what vision delivers. The key to using visual information is not to remold it but to access it properly, and that calls for a useful reference frame or coordinate system. Reference frames are inextricable from the very idea of location. How do you answer the question "Where is it?" By naming an object that the asker already knows the frame of reference and describing how far and in what direction the "it" is, relative to the frame. A description in words like "next to the fridge," a street address, compass directions, latitude and longitude, Global Positioning System satellite coordinates they all indicate distance and direction relative to a reference frame. Einstein built his theory of relativity by questioning Newtons fictitious reference frame that was somehow anchored in empty space, independent of anything in it. The frame of reference packaged with the 2V2-D sketch is position on the retina. Since the retinas constantly gyrate, it is as useless ds directions like "Meet me next to the beige Pontiac thats stopped here at the light." We need a reference frame that stays put as the eyes rock and roll. Suppose there is a circuit that can slide an invisible reference frame over the visual field, like the crosshairs of a rifle sight sliding over a landscape. And suppose that any mechanism that scoops information out of the visual field is locked onto positions defined by the rifle sight (for example, at the hair-crossing, two notches above them, or a notch to the left). Computer displays have a vaguely similar device, the cursor. The commands that read and write information do so relative to a special point that can be positioned at will over the screen, and when the material on the screen scrolls around, the cursor moves with it, glued to its piece of The Minds Eye 263 text or graphics. For the brain to use the contents of the 2lh-D sketch, it must employ a similar mechanism, indeed, several of them. The simplest reference frame that moves over the 2V2-D sketch is one that stays riveted to the head. Thanks to the laws of optics, when the eyes move right, the image of the apple scoots left. But suppose the neural command to the eye muscles is ccd to the visual field, and is used to shift the crosshairs over by the same amount in the opposite direction. The crosshairs will stay on the apple, and so will any mental process that funnels information through the crosshairs. The process can happily continue as if nothing had happened, even though the contents of the visual field have slid around. Heres a simple demonstration of the ccing. Move your eyes; the world stands still. Now close one eye and nudge the other one with your finger; the world jumps. In both cases the eye moves, and in both cases the retinal image moves, but only when the eye is moved by a finger do you see the movement. When you move your eyes by deciding to look somewhere, the command to the eye muscles is copied to a mechanism that moves the reference frame together with the sliding images so as to cancel your subjective sense of motion. But when you move your eye by poking it with your finger, the frame-shifter is bypassed, the frame is not shifted, and you interpret the jerking image as coming from a jerking world. There may also be reference frames that compensate for movements of the head and body. They give each bit of', 'problems make one long '),

The challenge is not to discover the correct explanation of how that happens, but to imagine a theory that could explain how it happens, a theory that would place the phenomenon as an effect of some cause, any cause.

It does not say that there is some paradox of self-reference or infinite regress in a minds trying to understand itself. Psychologists and neuroscientists dont study their own minds; they study someone elses. Nor does it imply some principled limitation on the possibility of knowledge by any knower, like the Uncertainty Principle or Godels theorem. It is an observation about one organ of one species, equivalent to observing that cats are color-blind or that monkeys cannot learn long division. It does not justify religious or mystical beliefs but explains why they are futile. Philosophers would not be out of a job, because they clarify these problems, chip off chunks that can be solved, and solve them or hand them over to science to solve. The hypothesis does not imply that we have sighted the end of science or bumped into a barrier on how much we can ever learn about . The computational aspect of consciousness (what information is available to which processes), the neurological aspect (what in the brain correlates with consciousness), and the evolutionary aspect (when and why did the neurocomputational aspects emerge) are perfectly tractable, and I see no reason that we should not have decades of progress and eventually a complete understanding even if we never solve residual brain-teasers like whether your red is the same as my red or what it is like to be a bat. In mathematics, one says that the integers are closed under addition: adding two integers produces another integer; it can never produce a fraction. But that does not mean that the set of integers is finite. Humanly thinkable thoughts are closed under the workings of our cognitive faculties, and may never embrace the solutions to the mysteries of philosophy. But the set of thinkable thoughts may be infinite nonetheless. Is cognitive closure a pessimistic conclusion? Not at all! I find it exhilarating, a sign of great progress in our understanding of the mind. And it is my last opportunity to pursue the goal of this book: to get you to step outside your own mind for a moment and see your thoughts and feelings as magnificent contrivances of the natural world rather than as the only way that things could be. First, if the mind is a system of organs designed by natural selection, why should we ever have expected it to comprehend all mysteries, to grasp all truths? We should be thankful that the problems of science are close enough in structure to the problems of our foraging ancestors that we have made the progress that we have.

There is no good evidence for these scenarios, and I think two others are more plausible, both of which see personality as an adaptation rooted in the divergence of interests between parents and offspring. One is the childs battle plan for competing with its siblings, which I will discuss in the following section. The other is the childs battle plan for competing in its peer group. Judith Harris has amassed evidence that children everywhere are socialized by their peer group, not by their parents. At all ages children join various play groups, circles, gangs, packs, cliques, and salons, and they jockey for status within them. Each is a culture that absorbs some customs from the outside and generates many of its own. Childrens cultural heritage the rules of Ringolevio, the melody and lyrics of the nyah-nyah song, the belief that if you kill someone you legally have to pay for his gravestone is passed from child to child, sometimes for thousands of years. As children grow up they graduate from group to group and eventually join adult groups. Prestige at one level gives one a leg up at the next; most significantly, the leaders of young adolescent cliques are the first to date. At all ages children are driven to figure out what it takes to succeed among their peers and to give these strategies precedence over 450 J anything their parents foist on them. Weary parents know they are no match for a childs peers, and rightly obsess over the best neighborhood in which to bring their children up. Many successful people immigrated to this country as children and were not handicapped in the least by culturally inept parents who never learned the language or customs. As a researcher of language development I have always been struck by the way in which children rapidly pick up the language (especially the accent) of their peers, though they spend more time with their parents. Why arent children putty in parents hands? Like Trivers and Harris, I suspect it is because childrens genetic interests overlap only partly with their parents. Children take their calories and protection from their parents, because their parents are the only ones willing to provide them, but they get their information from the best sources they can find and forge their strategies for dealing with life themselves. Their own parents may not be the wisest and most knowledgeable adults around, and worse, the rules at home are often stacked against the children in favor of their born and unborn siblings. And as far as reproduction is concerned, the home is a dead end. The child will have to compete for mates, and before that for the status necessary to find and keep them, in other arenas, which play by different rules. The child had better master them. The conflict of interest between parents and offspring is unacknowledged in our public discourse about children. In most times and places, the advantage has been to the parents, and they have wielded their power as cruel tyrants. This century has seen the tables turn. Child-welfare experts flood the bookstores with parenting manuals and the government with policy advice. All politicians paint themselves as friends of children and their opponents as enemies.

But it is the only process that seemingly designs organisms over time. Dawkins stuck out his neck about extraterrestrial evolution because he reviewed every alternative to selection that has been proposed in the history of biology and showed that they are impotent to explain the signature of life, complex design. The folk theory that organisms respond to an urge to unfold into more complex and adaptive forms obviously wont do. The urge and, more important, the power to achieve its ambitions is a bit of magic that is left unexplained.

The problem goes beyond the many demonstrations that Lamarck was wrong in fact. (For example, if acquired traits really could be inherited, several hundred generations of circumcision should have caused Jewish boys today to be born without foreskins.) The deeper problem is that the theory would not be able to explain adaptive complexity even if it had turned out to be correct. First, using an organ does not, by itself, make the organ function better. The photons passing through a lens do not somehow wash it clear, and using a machine does not improve it but wears it out. Now, many parts of organisms do adjust adaptively to use: exercised muscle bulks up, rubbed skin thickens, sunlit skin darkens, rewarded acts increase and punished ones decrease. But these responses are themselves part of the evolved design of the organism, and we need to explain how they arose: no law of physics or chemistry makes rubbed things thicken or illuminated surfaces darken. The inheritance of acquired characteristics is even worse, for most acquired characteristics are cuts, scrapes, scars, decay, weathering, and other assaults by the pitiless world, not improvements. And even if a blow did lead to an improvement, it is mysterious how the size and shape of the helpful wound could be read off the affected flesh and encoded back into DNA instructions in the sperm or egg. Yet another failed theory is the one that invokes the macromutation: a mammoth copying error that begets a new kind of adapted organism in one fell swoop. The problem here is that the laws of probability astronomically militate against a large random copying error creating a complex functioning organ like the eye out of homogeneous flesh. Small random errors, in contrast, can make an organ a hit more like an eye, as in our example where an imaginable mutation might make a lens a tiny bit clearer or an eyeball a tiny bit rounder. Indeed, way before our scenario begins, a long sequence of small mutations must have accumulated to give the organism an eye at all. By looking at organisms with simpler eyes, Darwin reconstructed how that could have happened. A few mutations made a patch of skin cells light-sensitive, a few more made the underlying tissue opaque, others deepened it into a cup and then a spherical hollow. Subsequent mutations added a thin translucent cover, which subsequently was thickened into a lens, and so on. Each step offered a small improvement in vision.

With threats, as with promises, communication can be a liability. The kidnapper remains incommunicado after making the ransom demand so he cannot be persuaded to give up the hostage for a smaller ransom or a safe escape. Rationality is also a liability. Schelling points out that "if a man knocks at the back door and says that he will stab himself unless you give him $10, he is more likely to get the $10 if his eyes are bloodshot." Terrorists, kidnappers, hijackers, and dictators of small countries have an interest in appearing mentally unbalanced. An absence of self-interest is also an advantage. Suicide bombers are almost impossible to stop. To defend yourself against threats, make it impossible for the threatener to make you an offer you cant refuse. Again, freedom, information, and rationality are handicaps. "Driver does not know combination to safe," says the sticker on the delivery truck. A man who is worried that his daughter may be kidnapped can give away his fortune, leave town and remain incommunicado, lobby for a law that makes it a crime to pay ransom, or break the hand with which he signs checks. An invading army may burn bridges behind it to make retreat impossible. A college president tells protesters he has no influence on the town police, and genuinely wants no influence. A racketeer cannot sell protection if the customer makes sure he is not at home when the racketeer comes around. Because an expensive threat works both ways, it can lead to a cycle of self-incapacitation. Protesters attempt to block the construction of a nuclear power plant by lying down on the railroad tracks leading to the site. The engineer, being reasonable, has no choice but to stop the train. The railroad company counters by telling the engineer to set the throttle so that the train moves very slowly and then to jump out of the train and walk beside it. The protesters must scramble. Next time the protesters handcuff themselves to the tracks; the engineer does not dare leave the train. But the protesters must be certain the engineer sees them in 412 enough time to stop. The company assigns the next train to a nearsighted engineer. in these examples, many of them from Schelling, the paradoxical power comes from a physical constraint like handcuffs or an institutional constraint like the police.

This kind of reasoning takes a long time if all the compatibilities must be tested one at a time. But in an auto-associator, they are coded beforehand in the connections, and the network can evaluate them all at once. Suppose each interpretation is a toy neuron, one for sinned, one for send, and so on. Suppose that pairs of units whose interpretations are consistent are connected with positive weights and pairs of units whose interpretations are inconsistent are connected with negative weights. Activation will ricochet around the network, and if all goes well, it will settle into a state in which the greatest number of mutually consistent interpretations are active. A good metaphor is a soap bubble that wobbles in eggy and amoeboid shapes as the tugs among its neighboring molecules pull it into a sphere. Sometimes a constraint network can have mutually inconsistent but equally stable states. That captures the phenomenon of global ambiguity, in which an entire object, not just its parts, can be interpreted in two ways. If you stare at the drawing of a cube on page 107 (called a Necker cube), your perception will flip from a downward view of its top face to an upward view of its bottom face. When the global flip occurs, the interpretations of all of the local parts are dragged with it. Every near edge becomes a far edge, every convex corner becomes a concave corner, and so on. Or vice versa: if you try to see a convex corner as concave, you can sometimes nudge the whole cube into flipping. The dynamics can be captured in a network, shown below the Cube, in which the units represent the interpretations of the parts, and the interpretations that are consistent in a 3-D object excite each other while the ones that are inconsistent inhibit each other. A fourth advantage comes from a networks ability to generalize automatically. If we had connected our letter-detector (which funneled a bank of input units into a decision unit) to our letter-printer (which had an intention unit fanning out into a bank of output units), we would have made a simple read-write or lookup demon for example, one that responds to a B by printing a C.

One represents the fact that the animal is herbivorous, another that it is warm-blooded, and so on. With no units standing for a particular animal (that is, with no unit for "parrot"), the weights automatically represent statistical knowledge about classes of animals. They embody the knowledge that feathered things tend to be warm-blooded, animals with hair tend to bear live 108 J young, and so on.

We enjoy strawberry cheesecake, but not because we evolved a taste for it. We evolved circuits that gave us trickles of enjoyment from the sweet taste of ripe fruit, the creamy mouth feel of fats and oils from nuts and meat, and the coolness of fresh water. Cheesecake packs a sensual wallop unlike anything in the natural world because it is a brew of megadoses of agreeable stimuli which we concocted for the express purpose of pressing our pleasure buttons. Pornography is another pleasure technology. In this chapter I will suggest that the arts are a third. There is another way that the design of the mind can throw off fascinating but biologically functionless activities. The intellect evolved to crack the defenses of things in the natural and social world. It is made up of modules for reasoning about how objects, artifacts, living things, animals, and other human minds work (Chapter 5). There are problems in the universe other than those: where the universe came from, how physical flesh can give rise to sentient minds, why bad things happen to good people, what happens to our thoughts and feelings when we die. The mind can pose such questions but may not be equipped to answer them, even if the questions have answers. Given that the mind is a product of natural selection, it should not have a miraculous ability to commune with all truths; it should have a mere ability to solve problems that are sufficiently similar to the mundane survival challenges of our ancestors. According to a saying, if you give a boy a hammer, the whole world becomes a nail. If you give a species an elementary grasp of mechanics, biology, and psychology, the whole world becomes a machine, a jungle, and a society. I will suggest that religion and philosophy are in part the application of mental tools to problems they were not designed to solve. Some readers may be surprised to learn that after seven chapters of reverse-engineering the major parts of the mind, I will conclude by arguing that some of the activities we consider most profound are nonadaptive by-products. But both kinds of argument come from a single standard, the criteria for biological adaptation. For the same reason that it is wrong to write off language, stereo vision, and the emotions as evolutionary accidents namely, their universal, complex, reliably developing, well-engineered, reproduction-promoting design it is wrong to invent functions for activities that lack that design merely because we want to ennoble them with the imprimatur of biological adaptiveness. Many 526 writers have said that the "function" of the arts is to bring the community together, to help us see the world in new ways, to give us a sense of harmony with the cosmos, to allow us to experience the sublime, and so on. All these claims are true, but none is about adaptation in the technical sense that has organized this book: a mechanism that brings about effects that would have increased the number of copies of the genes building that mechanism in the environment in which we evolved.

Theres only so much brain power you need to subdue a plant or a rock, the argument goes, but the other guy is about as smart as you are and may use that intelligence against your interests. You had better think about what he is thinking about what you are thinking he is thinking. As far as brain power goes, theres no end to keeping up with the Joneses. My own guess is that a cognitive arms race by itself was not enough to launch human intelligence. Any social species can begin a never-ending escalation of brain power, but none except ours has, probably because without some other change in lifestyle, the costs of intelligence (brain size, extended childhood, and so on) would damp the positive feedback loop. Humans are exceptional in mechanical and biological, not just194 social, intelligence. In a species that runs on information, each faculty multiplies the value of the others. (Incidentally, the expansion of the human brain is no evolutionary freak crying out for a runaway positive feedback loop. The brain tripled in size in five million years, but that is leisurely by evolutionary timekeeping. There was enough time in hominid evolution for the brain to shoot up to human size, shrink back down, and shoot up again several times over.) A third pilot of intelligence, alongside good vision and big groups, is the hand. Primates evolved in trees and have hands to grasp the branches. Monkeys use all four limbs to run along the tops of branches, but apes hang from them, mainly by their arms. They have put their welldeveloped hands to use in manipulating objects. Gorillas meticulously dissect tough or thorny plants to pick out the edible matter, and chimpanzees use simple tools such as stems to fish out termites, rocks to bash open nuts, and mashed leaves to sponge up water. As Samuel Johnson said about dogs walking on their hind legs, while it is not done well, you are surprised to find it done at all. Hands are levers of influence on the world that make intelligence worth having. Precision hands and precision intelligence co-evolved in the human lineage, and the fossil record shows that hands led the way. Finely tooled hands are useless if you have to walk on them all the time, and they could not have evolved by themselves. Every bone in our bodies has been reshaped to give us our upright posture, which frees the hands for carrying and manipulating. Once again we have our ape ancestors to thank. Hanging from trees calls for a body plan that is different from the horizontal four-wheel-drive design of most mammals. Apes bodies are already tilted upward with arms that differ from their legs, and chimpanzees (and even monkeys) walk upright for short distances to carry food and objects. Fully upright posture may have evolved under several selection pressures. Bipedal walking is a biomechanically efficient way to retool a treehanging body to cover distance on the flat ground of the newly entered savanna. Upright posture also allows one to peer over grass like a marmot. Hominids go out in the midday sun; this zoologically unusual work shift brought in several human adaptations for keeping cool, such as hairlessness and profuse sweating. Upright posture might be another; it is the opposite of lying down to get a tan. But carrying and manipulation must have been crucial inducements.

Filicides and parricides in most of the world are touched off by such competition. Parents also arrange marriages, which is a polite way of saying that they sell or trade their children.

(In 1977 a Saudi princess was publicly stoned to death for bringing dishonor to her grandfather, the brother of the king, by having an indiscreet affair in London.) Parent-daughter conflict is a special case of conflict over the "ownership" of womens sexuality, a topic to which we will return. The other popular theory subverted by parent-offspring conflict is the biology-culture distinction, in which babies are a bundle of uncivilized instincts and parents socialize them into competent, well-adjusted members of society. Personality, in this conventional wisdom, is shaped in the formative years by the parenting process. Parents and children both want the children to prosper in the social milieu, and since children are in no position to shape themselves, socialization represents a confluence of their interests. Trivers reasoned that, according to the theory of parent-offspring conflict, parents should not necessarily have their childrens interests at heart when they try to socialize them. Just as parents often act against a childs interests, they may try to train the child to act against its own interests. Parents want each child to act more altruistically to its siblings than the child wants to. That is because it pays the parents for a child to be altruistic when the benefit to a sibling exceeds the cost to the child, but it pays the child to be altruistic only when the benefit exceeds twice the cost. For more distant kin such as half-siblings and cousins, the difference between the parents interests and the childs interests is even greater, because the parent is more closely related to the half-sibling or cousin than the child is. Similarly, parents may try to persuade children that staying home to help at the nest, allowing themselves to be sold in 448 marriage, and other outcomes that are good for the parent (and hence the childs unborn siblings) are in fact good for the child. As in all arenas of conflict, parents may resort to deception and, since children are no', 'several wives they might '),

It might be wasted on an already secure ally or an implacable foe, but could make all the difference for a clan whose sympathies are somewhere in between. Strategic matchmaking is one outcome of the psychology of kinship; another is rules about who can marry whom. In many cultures people are encouraged to marry their cross cousins and forbidden to marry their parallel cousins. A cross cousin is the child of your mothers brother or of your fathers sister; a parallel cousin is a child of your mothers sister or of your fathers brother. Why the distinction? Consider the most common arrangement, in which daughters are traded among clans of related males, and imagine yourself contemplating marriage with various cousins (it doesnt matter whether you are male or female). If you marry your cross cousin, you are consummating an exchange with a proven trading partner: a clan with which your own family (presided over by your paternal grandfather) has traded a bride in the past (your mother or your aunt). If you marry your parallel cousin, either you are marrying within the clan (if your father and the father of your betrothed are brothers) and bringing in no external goods, or you are marrying someone from a clan of strangers (if your mother and the mother of your betrothed are sisters). These intrigues have spawned two of the modern myths of kinship: that in traditional societies, people have no voice in whom they marry, and that kinship has nothing to do with genetic relatedness. The grain of truth in the first myth is that parents everywhere wield as much power as they can to influence whom their children marry. Children do not, however, passively accept their parents choice. People everywhere have powerful emotions about whom they want to marry that is, romantic love and engagements are often fierce battles of wills between parents and children. Even when parents have the final say, the children lobby day and night to make their feelings known, and the feelings almost always enter 438 into the decision. The plot of Sholem Aleichems Tevyes Daughters (adapted into the musical Fiddler on the Roof) unfolds on this battlefield, and similar plots are found across the world. When children elope, it is a catastrophe for their parents. The business deal or strategic opportunity of a lifetime may have just been frittered away. Worse, if the parents had pledged the child years before which often happens, because children are born at different times and the second half of an exchange must wait until a child reaches marriageable age the parents are now in default and at the mercy of the loan sharks. Or the parents may have mortgaged themselves to the eyeballs to buy a spouse for the departed child. Defaults on marriage agreements are a leading cause of feuding and warfare in traditional societies. With the stakes so high, it is no wonder that the parents generation always teaches that romantic love is frivolous or does not exist at all. The intellectuals who conclude that romantic love is a recent invention of medieval troubadours or of Hollywood scriptwriters have taken this establishment propaganda at face value. Those who take fictive kin as evidence that kinship has nothing to do with biology have also bought an official doctrine.

Does all this accounting come from our alienation and bourgeois values in a capitalist society? One of the fondest beliefs of many intellectuals is that there are cultures out there where everyone shares freely. Marx and Engels thought that preliterate peoples represented a first stage in the evolution of civilization called primitive communism, whose maxim was "From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs." Indeed, people in foraging societies do share food and risk. But in many of them, people interact mainly with their kin, so in the biologists sense they are sharing with extensions of themselves. Many cultures also have an ideal of sharing, but that means little. Of course I will proclaim how great it is for you to share; the question is, will J share when my turn comes? Family Values 505 Foraging peoples, to be sure, really do share with nonrelatives, but not out of indiscriminate largesse or a commitment to socialist principles. The data from anthropology show that the sharing is driven by cost-benefit analyses and a careful mental ledger for reciprocation. People share when it would be suicidal not to. In general, species are driven to share when the variance of success in gathering food is. high. Say in some weeks I am lucky and have more food than I can eat, but in other weeks I am unlucky and in danger of starving. How can I store extra food in the fat weeks and draw on it in the lean weeks? Refrigeration is not an option. I could gorge on it now and store it as blubber, but that works only up to a point; I cant eat enough in a day to avoid hunger for a month. But I can store it in the bodies and minds of other people, in the form of a memory of my generosity they feel obliged to repay when fortunes reverse. When the prospects are risky, it pays to pool the risks. The theory has been confirmed in nonhuman species, such as vampire bats, and it has also been confirmed in humans in two elegant studies that control for differences among cultures by contrasting the forms of sharing within a culture. The Ache of Paraguay hunt game and gather plant foods. Hunting is largely a matter of luck: on any given day an Ache hunter has a forty percent chance of coming home empty-handed. Gathering is largely a matter of effort: the longer you work, the more you bring home, and an empty-handed gatherer is probably lazy rather than unlucky. As predicted, the Ache share plant foods only within the nuclear family but share meat throughout the band. The !Kung San of the Kalahari Desert are perhaps the closest thing the world has to primitive communists. Sharing is holy; boasting and hoarding are contemptible. They hunt and gather in a harsh, droughtprone ecosystem, and trade food and access to waterholes. The //Gana San, a neighboring branch of the same people, have taken to cultivating melons, which store water, and to herding goats. They do not yo-yo between good times and bad as much as their cousins, and unlike them, they hoard food and have developed inequalities in wealth and status. In both the Ache and the San, high-variance foods are shared, low-variance foods are hoarded. These people do not pull out calculators and compute the variances.

Infanticide in the modern West is similar. The statistics show that the mothers who let their infants die are young, poor, and unwed. There are many explanations, but the parallel with the rest of the world is unlikely to be a coincidence. Infanticidal mothers are not heartless, and even when infant mortality is common, people never treat young life casually. Mothers experience infanticide as an unavoidable tragedy. They grieve for the child and remember it with pain all their lives. In many cultures people try to distance their emotions from a newborn until they are assured it will survive. They may not touch, name, or grant legal personhood to a baby until a danger period is over, much like our own customs of the christening and the bris (the circumcision of eight-day-old Jewish boys). The emotions of new mothers, which would drive the decision to keep a baby or let it die, may have been shaped by these actuarial facts. Postpartum depression has been written off as a hormonal delirium, but as with all explanations of complex emotions, one must askwhy the brain is wired so as to let hormones have their effects. In most of human evolutionary history, a new mother had good reason to pause and take stock. She faced a decision between a definite tragedy now and a chance of an even greater tragedy years hence, and the choice was not to be taken lightly. Even today, the typical rumination of a depressed new mother how will I cope with this burden? is a genuine issue. The depression is most severe in the circumstances that lead mothers elsewhere in the world to commit infanticide, such as poverty, marital conflict, and single motherhood. The emotional response called "bonding" is also surely more sophisticated than the stereotype in which a woman is smitten with a lifelong attachment to her baby if she interacts with it in a critical window after birth, like the victims of Puck in A Midsummer Nights Dream who became infatuated with the first person they saw upon awakening. Mothers appear to proceed from a cool assessment of the infant and their current prospects, to an appreciation of the infant as a uniquely wonderful individual after about a week, to a gradual deepening of love over the next few years. The infant is an interested party, and fights for its interests with the only weapon at its disposal: cuteness. Newborns are precociously responsive to their mothers; they smile, make eye contact, perk up to her speech, even mimic her facial expressions. These advertisements of a functioning nervous system could melt a mothers heart and tip the balance in a close Family Values 445 decision of whether to keep the baby. The ethologist Konrad Lorenz pointed out that the geometry of babies a large head, a bulbous cranium, large eyes low in the face, pudgy cheeks, and short limbs elicits tenderness and affection. The geometry comes from the baby-assembly process. The head end grows fastest in the womb, and the other end catches up after birth; babies grow into their brain and their eyes. Lorenz showed that animals with that geometry, such as ducks and rabbits, strike people as cute. In his essay "A Biological Homage to Mickey Mouse," Stephen Jay Gould showed that cartoonists exploit the geometry to make their characters more appealing.

(305, 129, 3, 'something that no one in the two-thousandyear history of pontificating about humor had ever thought to do: he went out to see what makes people laugh. He had his assistants hang out on the college campus near groups of people in conversation and surreptitiously note what triggered their laughter. What did he find? A typical laugh line was, "Ill see you guys later," or "What is that supposed to mean?!" As they say, you had to be there. Only about ten to twenty percent of the episodes could be classified as humorous, and then only by the most indulgent standards. The funniest lines in twelve hundred examples were, "You dont have to drink; just buy us drinks," "Do you date within your species?" and "Are you working here or just trying to look busy?" Provine notes, "The frequent laughter heard at crowded social gatherings is not due to a furious rate of joke telling by guests. Most pre-laugh dialogue is like that of an interminable television situation comedy scripted by an extremely ungifted writer." How do we explain the appeal of the barely humorous banter that incites most of our laughter? If humor is an anti-dominance poison, a dignicide, it need not be used only for harmful purposes. The point of Chapter 7 was that when people interact with each other they have to choose from a menu of different social psychologies, each with a different logic. The logic of dominance and status is based on implicit threats and bribes, and it vanishes when the superior can no longer make good on them. The logic of friendship is based on a commitment to mutual unmeasured aid, come what may. People want status and dominance, but they also want friends, because status and dominance can fade but a friend will be there through thick and thin. The two are incompatible, and that raises a signaling problem. Given any two people, one will always be stronger, smarter, wealthier, better-looking, or better connected than the other. The triggers 554 J of a dominant-submissive or celebrity-fan relationship are always there, but neither party may want the relationship to go in that direction. By deprecating the qualities that you could have lorded over a friend or that a friend could have lorded over you, you are conveying that the basis of the relationship, as far as you are concerned, is not status or dominance. All the better if the signal is involuntary and hence hard to fake. If this idea is correct, it would explain the homology between adult human laughter and the response to mock aggression and tickling in children and chimpanzees. The laughter says, It may look like Im trying to hurt you, but Im doing something that both of us want. The idea also explains why kidding is a precision instrument for assessing the kind of relationship one has with a person. You dont tease a superior or a stranger, though if one of you floats a trial tease that is well received, you know the ice is breaking and the relationship is shifting toward friendship. And if the tease elicits a mirthless chuckle or a freezing silence, you are being told that the grouch has no desire to become your friend (and may even have interpreted the joke as an aggressive challenge). The recurring giggles that envelop good friends are reavowals that the basis of the relationship is still friendship, despite the constant temptations for one party to have the upper hand.

An artifact is an object suitable for attaining some 328 end that a person intends to be used for attaining that end. The mixture of mechanics and psychology makes artifacts a strange category. Artifacts cant be defined by their shape or their constitution, only by what they can do and by what someone, somewhere, wants them to do. A store in my neighborhood sells nothing but chairs, but its inventory is as varied as a department stores. It has stools, high-backed dining chairs, recliners, beanbags, elastics and wires stretched over frames, hammocks, wooden cubes, plastic Ss, and foam-rubber cylinders. We call them all chairs because they are designed to hold people up. A stump or an elephants foot can become a chair if someone decides to use it as one. Probably somewhere in the forests of the world there is a knot of branches that uncannily resembles a chair. But like the proverbial falling tree that makes no sound, it is not a chair until someone decides to treat it as one. Keils young subjects who happily let coffeepots turn into birdfeeders get the idea. An extraterrestrial physicist or geometer, unless it had our psychology, would be baffled by some of the things we think exist in the world when these things are artifacts. Chomsky points out that we can say that the book John is writing will weigh five pounds when it is published: "the book" is both a stream of ideas in Johns head and an object with mass. We talk about a house burning down to nothing and being rebuilt; somehow, its the same house. Consider what kind of object "a city" must be, given that we can say London is so unhappy, ugly, and polluted that it should be destroyed and rebuilt a hundred miles away. When Atran claimed that folk biology mirrors professional biology, he was criticized because folk categories like "vegetable" and "pet" match no Linnaean taxon. He replies that they are artifacts. Not only are they defined by the needs they serve (savory, succulent food; tractable companions), but they are, quite literally, human products. Millennia of selective breeding have created corn out of a grass and carrots out of a root. One has only to imagine packs of French poodles roaming the primeval forests to realize that most pets are human creations, too. Daniel Dennett proposes that the mind adopts a "design stance" when dealing with artifacts, complementing its "physical stance" for objects like rocks and its "intentional stance" for minds. In the design stance, one imputes an intention to a real or hypothetical designer. Some objects are so suited to accomplishing an improbable outcome that the attribution is easy. As Dennett writes, "There can be little doubt what an axe is, or what a telephone is for; we hardly need to consult Alexander Good Ideas 329 Graham Bells biography for clues about what he had in mind." Others are notoriously open to rival interpretations, like paintings and sculpture, which are sometimes designed to have an inscrutable design. Still others, like Stonehenge or an assembly of gears found in a shipwreck, probably have a function, though we dont know what it is. Artifacts, because they depend on human intentions, are subject to interpretation and criticism just as if they were works of art, an activity Dennett calls "artifact hermeneutics."

A computer displays each image on a little LCD screen with a lens in front of it, mounted in front of each eye on the inside of a helmet or visor. These technologies all force the viewer to don or peer through some kind of apparatus. The illusionists dream is a stereogram that can be seen with the naked eye an autostereogram. The Minds Eye 225 The principle was discovered a century and a half ago by David Brewster, the Scottish physicist who also studied polarized light and invented the kaleidoscope and the Victorian-era stereoscope. Brewster noticed that the repeating patterns on wallpaper can leap out in depth. Adjacent copies of the pattern, say a flower, can each lure one eye into fixating on it. That can happen because identical flowers are positioned at the same places on the two retinas, so the double image looks like a single image. In fact, like a misbuttoned shirt, a whole parade of double images can falsely mesh into a single image, except for the unpaired members at each end. The brain, seeing no double image, is prematurely satisfied that it has converged the eyes properly, and locks them into the false alignment. This leaves the eyes aimed at an imaginary point behind the wall, and the flowers seem to float in space at that distance. They also seem inflated, because the brain does its trigonometry and calculates how big the flower would have to be at that depth to project its current retinal image. what the eyes should do what the repeating pattern tricks the eyes into doing An easy way to experience the wallpaper effect is to stare at a tile wall a few inches away, too close to focus and converge on comfortably. (Many men rediscover the effect as they stand at a urinal.) The tiles in front of each eye easily fuse, creating the surreal impression of a very large tile wall a great distance away. The wall bows outward, and as the head moves from side to side the wall rocks in the opposite direction. Both would have to happen in the world if the wall were really at that distance while projecting the current retinal image. The brain creates those illusions in its headlong attempt to keep the geometry of the whole hallucination consistent. 226 J Brewster also noticed that any irregularity in the spacing of a pair of copies makes them protrude or recess from the rest. Imagine that the flowers pierced by the lines of sight in the diagram are printed a bit closer to each other. The lines of sight are brought together aind cross each other closer to the eyes. The images on the retina will splay out to the temples, and the brain sees the imaginary flower as being nearer. Similarly, if the flowers had been printed a bit farther apart, the lines of sight will cross farther away, and their retinal projections will crowd toward the nose. The brain hallucinates the ghost object at a slightly greater distance. We have now arrived at a simple kind of "magic eye" illusion, the wallpaper autostereogram. Some of the stereograms in the books and greeting cards show rows of repeating figures trees, clouds, mountains, people. When you view the stereogram, each tier of objects drifts in or out and lands at its own depth (although in these autostereograms, unlike the squiggly ones, no new shape emerges; well come to those soon).', 'technology is used in '),
(308, 132, 3, 'tells us what should follow. Copulation should be conceived of as a female service, a favor that women can bestow on or withhold from men. Scores of metaphors treat sex with a woman as a precious commodity, whether they take the womans perspective {saving yourself, giving it away, feeling used) or the mans (getting any, sexual favors, getting lucky). And sexual transactions often obey market principles, as cynics of all persuasions have long recognized. The feminist theorist Andrea Dworkin has written, "A man wants what a woman has sex. He can steal it (rape), persuade her to give it away (seduction), rent it (prostitution), lease it over the long term (marriage in the United States) Or own it outright (marriage in most societies)." In all societies, it is mostly or entirely the men who woo, proposition, seduce, use love magic, give gifts in trade for sex, pay bride-prices (rather than collect dowries), hire prostitutes, and rape. Sexual economics, of course, also depends on the desirability of the individuals, not just the average desires of the sexes. People "pay" for sex in cash, commitment, or favors when the partner is more desirable than they are. Since women are more discriminating than men, the average man has to pay for sex with the average woman. An average man can attract a higher-quality wife than casual sex partner (assuming that a marriage commitment is a kind of payment), whereas a woman can attract a higher-quality casual sex partner (who would pay nothing) than husband. The highest-quality men, in theory, should have a large number of women willing to have sex with them. A cartoon by Dan Wasserman shows a couple leaving the theater after having seen Indecent Proposal. The husband says, "Would you sleep with Robert Redford for a million dollars?" She replies, "Yes, but theyd have to give me some time to come up with the money." The cartoonists wit, though, exploits our sense of surprise. We dont expect real life to work that way. The men most attractive to women do Family Values . 475 not hire themselves out as prostitutes; they may even hire prostitutes themselves. In 1995, the actor Hugh Grant, arguably the worlds handsomest man, was arrested for having oral sex with a prostitute in the front seat of his car. The simple economic analysis fails here because money and sex are not completely fungible. As we shall see, part of mens attractiveness comes from their wealth, so the most attractive men dont need the money. And the "payment" that most women hope for is not cash but long-term commitment, which is a scarce resource even for the handsomest and wealthiest man. The economics of the Hugh Grant affair are well summed up by an exchange from another movie, based on the story of Heidi Fleiss, the Hollywood madame. A call girl asks her friend why her handsome tricks have to pay for sex. "Theyre not paying you for the sex," the friend explains. "Theyre paying you to go away afterwards." Could it be that men learn to want sexual variety? Perhaps it is a means to an end, the end being status in our society. The Don Juan is revered as a dashing stud; the pretty woman on his arm is a trophy. Certainly anything that is desirable and rare can become a status symbol. But that does not mean that all desirable things are pursued because they are status symbols.

Decades before Tooby and Cosmides spelled out this logic, the psychologist Anatol Rapoport illustrated it with a paradox from World War II. (He believed the scenario was true but was unable to verify it.) At a bomber base in the Pacific, a flier had only a twenty-five percent chance of surviving his quota of missions. Someone calculated that if the fliers carried twice as many bombs, a mission could be carried out with half as Family Values 517 many flights. But the only way to increase the payload was to reduce the fuel, which meant that the planes would have to fly on one-way missions. If the fliers would be willing to draw lots and take a one-in-two chance of flying off to a certain death instead of hanging on to their three-in-four chance of flying off to an unpredictable death, they would double their chance of survival: only half of them would die instead of three-quarters. Needless to say, it was never implemented. Few of us would accept such an offer, though it is completely fair and would save many lives, including, possibly, our own. The paradox is an intriguing demonstration that our mind is equipped to volunteer for a risk of death in a coalition but only if we do not know when death will come. HUMANITY So should we all just take poison now and be done with it? Some people think that evolutionary psychology claims to have discovered that human nature is selfish and wicked. But they are flattering the researchers and anyone who would claim to have discovered the opposite. No one needs a scientist to measure whether humans are prone to knavery. The question has been answered in the history books, the newspapers, the ethnographic record, and the letters to Ann Landers. But people treat it like an open question, as if someday science might discover that its all a bad dream and we will wake up to find that it is human nature to love one another. The task of evolutionary psychology is not to weigh in on human nature, a task better left to others. It is to add the satisfying kind of insight that only science can provide: to connect what we know about human nature with the rest of our knowledge of how the world works, and to explain the largest number of facts with the smallest number of assumptions. Already a large part of our social psychology, well documented in the lab and the field, can be shown to fall out of a few assumptions about kin selection, parental investment, reciprocal altruism, and the computational theory of mind. So does human nature doom us to a nightmare of exploitation by ruthless fitness-maximizersr1 Again, it is silly to look to science for the answer. Everyone knows that people are capable of monumental kindness and sacrifice. The mind has many components, and accommodates not only ugly motives but love, friendship, cooperation, a sense of fair518 J ness, and an ability to predict the consequences of our actions. The different parts of the mind struggle to engage or disengage the clutch pedal of behavior, so bad thoughts do not always cause bad deeds.

But the prying American press has found no evidence that he has committed it in real life even once. And', 'that make fate unknowable '),

As with all rules, the challenge is to work around them without making them a farce. An obvious solution is to redefine who is related to whom. An eligible bachelor might be called a cross cousin even if the genealogical diagram says otherwise, saving a daughter from spinsterhood without setting the precedent that other children can marry whom they please. But deep down no one is fooled by these face-saving measures. A similar hypocrisy applies to other fictive kin. With kin emotions being so powerful, manipulators try to tap them for solidarity among non-kin by calling the non-kin kin. The tactic has been rediscovered again and again, from tribal chiefs to modern preachers and sappy rock musicians. But even in tribes where fictive kin labels are publicly treated with the utmost seriousness, if you press someone in private he will acknowledge that so-and-so is not really his brother or cousin. And when people show their true colors in a dispute, the colors go with blood relatives, not fictive ones. Many modern parents tell their children to address family friends as Uncle and Aunt. When I was a child, my friends and I used to refer to them as our fake uncles and fake aunts. Children are even more adamant in resisting the ubiquitous pressure to call their new stepparents Mom and Dad. Family Values 439 For millennia, kin emotions have shaped even the largest societies. The reach of parental love can extend over generations via gifts and inheritance. Parental love causes the fundamental paradox of politics: no society can be simultaneously fair, free, and equal. If it is fair, people who work harder can accumulate more. If it is free, people will give their wealth to their children. But then it cannot be equal, for some people will inherit wealth they did not earn. Ever since Plato called attention to these tradeoffs in The Republic, most political ideologies can be defined by the stance they take on which of these ideals should yield. Another surprising consequence of kin solidarity is that the family is a subversive organization. That conclusion flies in the face of the rightwing view that the church and state have always been steadfast upholders of the family and of the left-wing view that the family is a bourgeois, patriarchal institution designed to suppress women, weaken class solidarity, and manufacture docile consumers. The journalist Ferdinand Mount has documented how every political and religious movement in history has sought to undermine the family. The reasons are obvious. Not only is the family a rival coalition competing for a persons loyalties, but it is a rival with an unfair advantage: relatives innately care for one another more than comrades do. They bestow nepotistic benefits, forgive the daily frictions that strain other organizations, and stop at nothing to avenge wrongs against a member. Leninism, Nazism, and other totalitarian ideologies always demand a new loyalty "higher" than, and contrary to, family ties. So have religions from early Christianity to the Moonies ("Were your family now!"). In Matthew 10:34-37, Jesus says: Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.

In primitive warfare, mobilization was more complete, battles were more frequent, casualties higher, prisoners fewer, and weapons more damaging. War is, to put it mildly, a major selection pressure, and since it appears to have been a recurring event in our evolutionary history, it must have shaped parts of the human psyche. Why would anyone be so stupid as to start a war? Tribal people can fight over anything of value, and the causes of tribal wars are as difficult to disentangle as the causes of World War I. But one motive that is surprising to Westerners appears over and over. In foraging societies, men go to war to get or keep women not necessarily as a conscious goal of the warriors (though often it is exactly that), but as the ultimate payoff that allowed a willingness to fight to evolve. Access to women is the limiting factor on males reproductive success. Having two wives can double a mans children, having three wives can triple it, and so on. For a man who is not at deaths door, no other resource has as much impact on evolutionary fitness. The most common spoils of tribal warfare are women. Raiders kill the men, abduct the nubile women, gang-rape them, and allocate them as wives. Chagnon discovered that Yanomamo men who had killed an enemy had three times as many wives and three times as many children as those who had not. Most young men who had killed were married; most young men who had never killed were not. The difference is not an accident of other differences between the killers and the nonkillers, such as size, strength, or number of kin. Killers are held in esteem in Yanomamo villages; they attract and are ceded more wives. The Yanomamo sometimes plan raids just to abduct women. More frequently, they plan them to avenge a past killing or abduction, but they always try to abduct women, too. Blood feuds, in which relatives avenge a death with a death, either of the killer or of his relatives, are the major impetus to extended violence everywhere; the motive that drives them has an obvious deterrent function, as we saw in Chapter 6. Blood feuds can extend for decades or longer because each side counts the score differently, so at any time each remembers injustices that must be redressed. (Imagine your feelings toward a neighboring people that has murdered Family Values 511 your husband, your brothers, and your sons, or has raped and abducted your wife, your daughters, and your sisters.) But the feuders do not stop at an eye for an eye. If they see an opportunity to get rid of a headache once and for all by massacring their opponents, they may do so, with the women as an extra incentive. The desire for women not only helps to fuel blood feuds; it also helps to spark them in the first place. Usually the first killing was over a woman: a man seduces or abducts someones wife, or reneges on a deal to trade a daughter. Modern people have trouble believing that preliterate tribes go to war over women. One anthropologist wrote to Chagnon, "Women? Fighting over women? Gold and diamonds I can understand, but women? Never." The reaction, of course, is biologically topsy-turvy. Other anthropologists argued that the Yanomamo suffered from a protein shortage', 'The archeologist Lawrence Keeley '),
(312, 136, 3, 'the argument for the theory of natural selection. Natural selection is the only explanation we have of how complex life can evolve, putting aside the question of how it did evolve. If Dawkins is right, as I think he is, natural selection is indispensable to understanding the human mind. If it is the only explanation of the evolution of little green men, it certainly is the only explanation of the evolution of big brown and beige ones. The theory of natural selection like the other foundation of this book, the computational theory of mind has an odd status in modern intellectual life. Within its home discipline, it is indispensable, explaining thousands of discoveries in a coherent framework and constantly inspiring new ones. But outside its home, it is misunderstood and reviled. As in Chapter 2, I want to spell out the case for this foundational idea: how it explains a key mystery that its alternatives cannot explain, how it has been verified in the lab and the field, and why some famous arguments against it are wrong. Natural selection has a special place in science because it alone explains what makes life special. Life fascinates us because of its adaptive complexity or complex design. Living things are not just pretty bits of bric-a-brac, but do amazing things. They fly, or swim, or see, or digest 156 food, or catch prey, or manufacture honey or silk or wood or poison. These are rare accomplishments, beyond the means of puddles, rocks, clouds, and other nonliving things. We would call a heap of extraterrestrial matter "life" only if it achieved comparable feats. Rare accomplishments come from special structures. Animals can see and rocks cant because animals have eyes, and eyes have precise arrangements of unusual materials capable of forming an image: a cornea that focuses light, a lens that adjusts the focus to the objects depth, an iris that opens and closes to let in the right amount of light, a sphere of transparent jelly that maintains the eyes shape, a retina at the focal plane of the lens, muscles that aim the eyes up-and-down, side-to-side, and in-and-out, rods and cones that transduce light into neural signals, and more, all exquisitely shaped and arranged. The odds are mind-bogglingly stacked against these structures being assembled out of raw materials by tornados, landslides, waterfalls, or the lightning bolt vaporizing swamp goo in the philosophers thought experiment. The eye has so many parts, arranged so precisely, that it appears to have been designed in advance with the goal of putting together something that sees. The same is true for our other organs. Our joints are lubricated to pivot smoothly, our teeth meet to sheer and grind, our hearts pump blood every organ seems to have been designed with a function in mind. One of the reasons God was invented was to be the mind that formed and executed lifes plans. The laws of the world work forwards, not backwards: rain causes the ground to be wet; the grounds benefiting from being wet cannot cause the rain. What else but the plans of God could effect the teleology (goal-directedness) of life on earth? Darwin showed what else. He identified a forward-causation physical process that mimics the paradoxical appearance of backward causation or teleology. The trick is replication. A replicator is something that can make a copy of itself, with most of its traits duplicated in the copy, including the ability to replicate in turn. Consider two states of affairs, A and B. B cant cause A if A comes first. (Seeing weft cant cause an eye to have a', 'the argument for the '),
(313, 137, 3, 'the brain But people live for a paltry two billion seconds, and there is no known reason why the brain could not record every object and event we experience if it had to. Also, we often remember both a category and its members, such as months, family members, continents, and baseball teams, so the category adds to the memory load. Good Ideas 307 The other putative reason is that the brain is compelled to organize; without categories, mental life would be chaos. But organization for its own sake is useless. I have a compulsive friend whose wife tells callers that he cannot come to the phone because he is alphabetizing his shirts. Occasionally I receive lengthy manuscripts from theoreticians who have discovered that everything in the universe falls into classes of three: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; protons, neutrons, and electrons; masculine, feminine, and neuter; Huey, Dewey, and Louie; and so on, for page after page. Jorge Luis Borges writes of a Chinese encyclopedia that divided animals into: (a) those that belong to the Emperor, (b) embalmed ones, (c) those that are trained, (d) suckling pigs, (e) mermaids, (f) fabulous ones, (g) stray dogs, (h) those that are included in this classification, (i) those that tremble as if they were mad, (j) innumerable ones, (k) those drawn with a very fine camels hair brush, (1) others, (m) those that have just broken a flower vase, (n) those that resemble flies from a distance. No, the mind has to get something out of forming categories, and that something is inference. Obviously we cant know everything about every object. But we can observe some of its properties, assign it to a category, and from the category predict properties that we have not observed. If Mopsy has long ears, he is a rabbit; if he is a rabbit, he should eat carrots, go hippety-hop, and breed like, well, a rabbit. The smaller the category, the better the prediction. Knowing that Peter is a cottontail, we can predict that he grows, breathes, moves, was suckled, inhabits open country or woodland clearings, spreads tularemia, and can contract myxomatosis. If we knew only that he was a mammal, the list would include only growing, breathing, moving, and being suckled. If we knew only that he was an animal, it would shrink to growing, breathing, and moving. On the other hand, its much harder to tag Peter as a cottontail than as a mammal or an animal. To tag him as a mammal we need only notice that he is furry and moving, but to tag him as a cottontail we have to notice that he has long ears, a short tail, long hind legs, and white on the underside of his tail. To identify very specific categories we have to examine so many properties that there would be few left to predict. Most of our everyday categories are somewhere in the middle: "rabbit," not mammal or cottontail; "car," not vehicle or Ford Tempo; "chair," not furniture or Barcalounger. They represent a compromise between how hard it is to identify the category and how much good the category does you. The psychologist Eleanor Rosch called them basic-level categories. They are 308 I the first words children learn for objects and generally the first mental label we assign when seeing them. What makes a category like "mammal" or "rabbit" better than a category like "shirts made by companies beginning with H" or "animals drawn with a very fine camels hair brush"? Many anthropologists and philosophers believe that categories are arbitrary conventions that we learn', 'the brain But people '),
(314, 138, 3, 'the common thread of religious practice in all cultures: religion is a technique for success. Ambrose Bierce defined to pray as "to ask that the laws of the universe be annulled on behalf of a single petitioner confessedly unworthy." People everywhere beseech gods and spirits for recovery from illness, for success in love or on the battlefield, and for good weather. Religion is a desperate measure that people resort to when the stakes are high and they have exhausted the usual techniques for the causation of success medicines, strategies, courtship, and, in the case of the weather, nothing. What kind of mind would do something as useless as inventing ghosts and bribing them for good weather? How does that fit into the idea that reasoning comes from a system of modules designed to figure out how the world works? The anthropologists Pascal Boyer and Dan Sperber have shown that it fits rather well. First, nonliterate peoples are not psychotic hallucinators who are unable to distinguish fantasy from reality. They know there is a humdrum world of people and objects driven by the usual laws, and find the ghosts and spirits of their belief system to be terrifying and fascinating precisely because they violate their own ordinary intuitions about the world. Second, the spirits, talismans, seers, and other sacred entities are never invented out of whole cloth. People take a construct from one of the cognitive modules of Chapter 5 an object, person, animal, natural substance, or artifact and cross out a property or write in a new one, letting the construct keep the rest of its standard-issue traits. A tool or weapon or substance will be granted some extra causal power but otherwise is expected to behave as it did before. It lives at one place at one time, is unable to pass through solid objects, and so on. A spirit is stipulated to be exempt from one or more of the laws of biology (growing, aging, dying), physics (solidity, visibility, causation by contact), or psychology (thoughts and desires are known only through behavior). But otherwise the spirit is recognizable as a kind of person or animal. Spirits see and hear, have a memory, have beliefs and desires, act on conditions that they believe will bring about a desired effect, make decisions, and issue threats and bargains. When the elders spread religious beliefs, they never bother to spell out these defaults. No one ever says, "If the spirits promise us good weather in exchange for a sacrifice, and they kn6w we want good weather, they predict that we will make the sacrifice." They dont have to, because they know that the minds of the pupils will autoThe Meaning of Life 557 matically supply these beliefs from their tacit knowledge of psychology. Believers also avoid working out the strange logical consequences of these piecemeal revisions of ordinary things. They dont pause to wonder why a God who knows our intentions has to listen to our prayers, or how a God can both see into the future and care about how we choose to act. Compared to the mind-bending ideas of modern science, religious beliefs are notable for their lack of imagination (God is a jealous man; heaven and hell are places; souls are people who have sprouted wings). That is because religious concepts are human concepts with a few emendations that make them wondrous and a longer list of standard traits that make them sensible to our ordinary ways of knowing. But where do people get the emendations? Even when all else has failed, why would they waste time spinning ideas and practices that', 'the common thread of '),
(315, 139, 3, 'The developmental saga though it is sensitive to changes in the animals experience, is not exactly "learning," in the sense of registering information from the world. Like an architect who hands a rough sketch to a low-level draftsman to straighten out the lines, the genes build eye-specific neurons crudely and then kick off a process that is guaranteed to sharpen them unless a neurobiologist meddles. 240 Once the brain has segregated the left eyes image from the right eyes, subsequent layers of neurons can compare them for the minute disparities that signal depth. These circuits, too, can be modified by the animals experience, though again in surprising ways. If an experimenter makes an animal cross-eyed or wall-eyed by cutting one of the eye muscles, the eyes point in different directions and never see the same thing on the two retinas at the same time. Of course, the eyes dont point 180 degrees apart, so in theory the brain could learn lo match the nut-ofwhack segments that do overlap. But apparently it is not equipped for matches that stretch more than a few degrees across the two eyes; the animal grows up stereoblind, and often functionally blind in one of the two eyes as well, a condition called amblyopia. (Amblyopia is sometimes called "lazy eye," but that is misleading. It is the brain, not the eye, that is insensitive, and the insensitivity is caused by the brain actively suppressing one eyes input in a kind of permanent rivalry, not by the brain lazily ignoring it.) Ifie same thing can happen in children. If one of the eyes is more farsighted than the other, the child habitually strains to focus on nearby objects, and [he reflex that couples focusing and convergence draws that eye inward. The two eyes point in different directions (a condition called strabismus), and their views dont align closely enough for the brain to use the disparity information in them. The child wilt grow up amblyopic and stereoblind unless early surgery on the eye muscles lines the eyeballs up. Until Hubel and Wiesel discovered these effects in monkeys and Held found similar ones in children, surgery for strabismus was considered cosmetic and done only on school-aged children. But there is a critical period for the proper alignment of two-eye neurons, a bit longer than the one for one-eye neurons but probably fading out near the age of one or two. Surgery after that point is often too late, Why is there a critical period, as opposed to rigid hard-wiring or lifelong openness to experience? In kittens, monkeys, and human babies, the face keeps growing after birth, and the eyes get pushed farther apart, Their relative vantage points change, and the neurons must keep up by retuning the range of intereye disparities they detect. Genes cannot anticipate the degree of spreading of the vantage points, because it depends on other genes, nutrition, and various accidents. So the neurons track the drifting eyes during the window of growth. When the eyes arrive at their grownup separation in the skull, the need disappears, and that is when the critical period ends. Some animals, like rabbits, have The Minds Eye 241 precocious babies whose eyes are set in adult positions within faces that grow very little. (These tend to be prey animals, which dont have the luxury of a long, helpless childhood.) The neurons that receive inputs from the two eyes dont need to retune themselves, and in fact these animals are wired at birth and do without a critical period of sensitivity to the input.

(316, 140, 3, 'The etymology is in a sense apt with the exception of astronomy, none of the liberal arts is about anything. They dont explain plants or animals or rocks or people; rather, they are intellectual tools that can be applied in any realm. Like the students who complain that algebra will never help them in the real world, one can wonder whether these abstract tools are useful enough in nature for natural selection to have inculcated them in the brain. Lets look at a modified trivium: logic, arithmetic, and probability. "Contrariwise," continued Tweedledee, "if it was so, it might be, and if it were so, it would be; but as it isnt, it aint. Thats logic!" Logic, in the technical sense, refers not to rationality in general but to inferring the truth of one statement from the truth of other statements based only on their form, not their content. I am using logic when I reason as follows. P is true, P implies Q, therefore Q is true. P and Q are 334 true, therefore P is true. P or Q is true, P is false, therefore Q is true. P implies Q, Q is false, therefore P is false. I can derive all these truths not knowing whether P means "There is a unicorn in the garden," "Iowa grows soybeans," or "My car has been eaten by rats." Does the brain do logic? College students performance on logic problems is not a pretty sight. There are some archeologists, biologists, and chess players in a room. None of the archeologists are biologists. All of the biologists are chess players. What, if anything, follows? A majority of students conclude that none of the archeologists are chess players, which is not valid. None of them conclude that some of the chess players are not archeologists, which is valid. In fact, a fifth claim that the premises allow no valid inferences. Spock always did say that humans are illogical. But as the psychologist John Macnamara has argued, that idea itself is barely logical. The rules of logic were originally seen as a formalization of the laws of thought. That went a bit overboard; logical truths are true regardless of how people think. But it is hard to imagine a species discovering logic if its brain did not give it a feeling of certitude when it found a logical truth. There is something peculiarly compelling, even irresistible, about P, P implies Q, therefore Q. With enough time and patience, we discover why our own logical errors are erroneous. We come to agree with one another on which truths are necessary. And we teach others not by force of authority but socratically, by causing the pupils to recognize truths by their own standards. People surely do use some kind of logic. All languages have logical terms like not, and, same, equivalent, and opposite. Children use and, not, or, and if appropriately before they turn three, not only in English but in half a dozen other languages that have been studied. Logical inferences are ubiquitous in human thought, particularly when we understand language. Here is a simple example from the psychologist Martin Braine: John went in for lunch. The menu showed a soup-and-salad special, with free beer or coffee. Also, with the steak you got a free glass of red wine. John chose the soup-and-salad special with coffee, along with something else to drink. (a) Did John get a free beer? (Yes, No, Cant Tell) (b) Did John get a free glass of wine? (Yes, No, Cant Tell) Virtually everyone deduces that the answer to (a)', 'The etymology is in '),
(317, 141, 3, 'the incipient wings of insects first evolved as adjustable solar panels, which soak up the suns energy when it is colder out and dissipate heat when its warmer. Using thermodynamic and aerodynamic analyses, Kingsolver and Koehl showed that proto-wings too small for flight are effective heat exchangers. The larger they grow, the more effective they become at heat regulation, though they reach a point of diminishing returns. That point is in the range of sizes in which the panels could serve as effective wings. Beyond that point, they become more and more useful for flying as they grow larger and larger, up to their present size. Natural selection could have pushed for bigger wings throughout the range from no wings to current wings, with a gradual change of function in the middle sizes. So how did the work get garbled into the preposterous story that one day an ancient insect took off by flapping unmodified solar panels and the rest of them have been doing it ever since? Partly it is a misunderstanding of a term introduced by Gould, exaptation, which refers to the adaptation of an old organ to a new function (Darwins "pre-adaptation") or the adaptation of a non-organ (bits of bone or tissue) to an organ with a function. Many readers have interpreted it as a new theory of evolution that has replaced adaptation and natural selection. Its not. Once again, complex design is the reason. Occasionally a machine designed for a complicated, improbable task can be pressed into service to do something simpler. A book of cartoons called 101 Uses for a Dead Computer showed PCs being used as a paperweight, an aquarium, a boat anchor, and so on. The humor comes from the relegation of sophisticated technology to a humble function that cruder devices can fulfill. But there will never be a book of cartoons called 101 Uses for a Dead Paperweight showing one being used as a computer. And so it is with exaptation in the living world. On engineering grounds, the odds are against an organ designed for one purpose being usable out of the box for some other purpose, unless the new purpose is quite simple. (And even then the nervous system of the animal must often be adapted for it to find and keep the new use.) If the new function is at all difficult to accomplish, natural selection must have revamped and retrofitted the part considerably as it did to give modern insects their wings. A housefly dodging a crazed human can decelerate from rapid flight, hover, turn in its own length, fly upside down, loop, roll, and land on the ceiling, all in less than a second. As an article entitled "The Mechanical Design of Insect Wings" notes, 172 [ "Subtle details of engineering and design, which no man-made airfoil can match, reveal how insect wings are remarkably adapted to the acrobatics of flight." The evolution of insect wings is an argument for natural selection, not against it. A change in selection pressure is not the same as no selection pressure. Complex design lies at the heart of all these arguments, and that offers a final excuse to dismiss Darwin. Isnt the whole idea a bit squishy? Since no one knows the number of kinds of possible organisms, how can anyone say that an infinitesimal fraction of them have eyes? Perhaps the idea is circular: the things one calls "adaptively complex" are just the things that one believes couldnt have evolved any other way than by natural selection.

(318, 142, 3, 'the inferred or imagined form is likely to be more perfect than it would appear if it were uncovered. Thus a square box covered with brown paper will be imagined as a perfect square. Unless the mind is given some very strong clue it is unlikely to visualize holes, dents, cracks, or other accidental qualities. In the same way, if we cast a drapery over a thigh, a leg, an arm or a breast, the imagination supposes a perfectly formed member; it does not and usually cannot envisage the irregularities and the imperfections which experience should lead us to expect.We know what [a body] is probably like from experience, and yet we are willing to suspend our disbelief in favour of the fictions of [the persons] wardrobe. Indeed I think that we are ready to go further in the way of self-deception. When we slip on our best jacket and see our deplorably unimpressive shoulders artfully magnified and idealised we do, for a moment, rise in our own esteem. Geons are not good for everything. Many natural objects, such as mountains and trees, have complicated fractal shapes, but geons turn them into pyramids and lollipops. And though geons can be built into a passable generic human face, like a snowman or Mr. Potato Head, it is almost impossible to build a model of a particular face Johns face, your grandmothers face that is different enough from other faces not to confuse them, but stable enough across smiles, frowns, weight gains, and aging to identify that person every time. Many psychologists believe that face recognition is special. In a social species like ours, faces are so important that natural selection gave us a processor that registers the kinds of geometric contours and ratios needed to tell them apart. Babies lock onto facelike patterns, but not onto other complex and symmetrical arrangements, when they are only thirty minutes old, and quickly learn to recognize their mothers, perhaps as early as the second day of life. Face recognition may even use distinct parts of the brain. An inability to recognize faces is called prosopagnosia. It is not the same as Oliver Sacks famous man who mistook his wife for a hat: prosopagnosics can tell a face from a hat; they just cant tell whose face it is. But many of them can recognize hats and almost everything else. For example, the patient "LH" was tested by the psychologists Nancy Etcoff and Kyle Cave and the neurologist Roy Freeman. LH is an intelligent, knowledgeable man who suffered head injuries in a car accident twenty years The Minds Eye 273 before the tests. Since the accident he has been utterly unable to recognize faces. He cannot recognize his wife and children (except by voice, scent, or gait), his own face in a mirror, or celebrities in photographs (unless they have a visual trademark like Einstein, Hitler, and the Beatles in their moptop days). It was not that he had trouble making out the details of a face; he could match full faces with their profiles, even in arty sidelighting, and assess their age, sex, and beauty. And he was virtually normal at recognizing complicated objects that were not faces, including words, clothing, hairstyles, vehicles, tools, vegetables, musical instruments, office chairs, eyeglasses, dot patterns, and television antenna-like shapes. There were only two kinds of shapes he had trouble with. He was embarrassed that he could not name his childrens animal crackers; similarly, in the lab he was below average at naming drawings of animals.

This "correspondence problem" was noticed in the sixteenth century by the astronomer Johannes Kepler, who thought about how stargazing eyes match up their thousands of white dots and how an objects position in space could be determined: from its multiple projections. The wallpaper stereogram works by coaxing the brain to accept a plausible but false solution to the correspondence problem. Until recently, everyone thought that the brain solved the correspondence problem in everyday scenes by first recognizing the objects in each eye and then matching up images of the same object. Lemon in left eye goes with lemon in right eye, cherries in left eye go with cherries in right eye. Stereo vision, guided by the intelligence of the whole person, could head off the mismatches by only joining up points that came from the same kind of object. A typical scene may contain millions of dots, but it will contain far fewer lemons, maybe only one. So if the brain tnatched whole objects, there would be fewer ways for it to go wrong. But nature did not opt for that solution. The first hint came from another of Ames wacky rooms. This time the indefatigable Ames built an ordinary rectangular room but glued leaves on every inch of its floor, (£ \ The Minds Eye 229 walls, and ceiling. When the room was viewed with one eye through a peephole, it looked like an amorphous sea of green. But when it was viewed with both eyes, it sprang into its correct three-dimensional shape, Ames had built a world that could he seen only by the mythical Cyclopean eye, not hy the left eye or the right eye alone. But how could the brain have matched up the two eyes views if it had to depend on recognizing and linking the objects in each oner The left eyes view was "leaf leaf leaf leaf leaf leaf leaf leaf." The right eyes view was "leaf leaf leaf leaf leaf leaf leaf loaf." The brain was faced with the hardest correspondence problem imaginable. Nonetheless it effortlessly coupled the views and conjured up a cyclopean vision. The demonstration is not airtight. What if the edges and corners of the room were not perfectly masked by the leaves? Perhaps each eye had a rough inkling of the rooms shape, and when the brain fused the two images it became more confident that the inklings were accurate. The airtight proof that the brain can solve the correspondence problem without recognizing objects came from an ingenious early use of computer graphics by the psychologist Bela Julesz, Before he fled Hungary for the United States in 1956, Julesz was a radar engineer with an interest in aerial reconnaissance. Spying from the air uses a clever trick: stereo views penetrate camouflage. A camouflaged object is covered with markings resembling the background it lies on, making the boundary between the object and its background invisible. But as long as the object is not pancake-flat, when it is viewed from two vantage points its markings will appear in slightly', 'the left eye with '),

I agree with Gould that the brain has been exapted for novelties like calculus or chess, but this is just an avowal of faith by people like us who believe in natural selection; it can hardly fail to be true. It raises the question of who or what is doing the elaborating and co-opting, and why the original structures were suited to being co-opted. The factory analogy is not helpful. A computer that issues paychecks cannot also analyze election returns or play tic-tac-toe, unless someone has reprogrammed it first. Wallace went off the tracks not because he was too much of an adaptationist but because he was a lousy linguist, psychologist, and anthropologist (to judge him, unfairly, by modern standards). He saw a chasm between the simple, concrete, here-and-now thinking of foraging peoples and the abstract rationality exercised in modern pursuits like science, mathematics, and chess. But there is no chasm. Wallace, to give him his due, was ahead of his time in realizing that foragers were not on the lower rungs of some biological ladder. But he was wrong about their language, thought, and lifestyle. Prospering as a forager is a more difficult problem than doing calculus or playing chess. As we saw in Chapter 3, people in all societies have words for abstract conceptions, have foresight beyond simple necessities, and combine, compare, and reason on general subjects that do not immediately appeal to their senses. And people everywhere put these abilities to good use in outwitting the defenses of the local flora and fauna. We will soon see that all people, right from the cradle, engage in a hind of scientific thinking. We are all intuitive physicists, biologists, engineers, psychologists, and mathematicians. Thanks to these inborn talents, we outperform robots and have wreaked havoc on the planet. On the other hand, our intuitive science is different from what the people in white coats do. Though most of us would not agree with Lucy 302 in Peanuts that fir trees give us fur, sparrows grow into eagles that we eat on Thanksgiving, and you can tell a trees age by counting its leaves, our beliefs are sometimes just as daffy. Children insist that a piece of styrofoam weighs nothing and that people know the outcome of events they did not witness or hear about. They grow into adults who think that a ball flying out of a spiral tube will continue in a spiral path and that a string of heads makes a coin more likely to land tails. This chapter is about human reasoning: how people make sense of their world. To reverse-engineer our faculties of reasoning, we must begin with Wallaces paradox. To dissolve it, we have to distinguish the intuitive science and mathematics that is part of the human birthright from the modern, institutionalized version that most people find so hard. Then we can explore how our intuitions work, where they came from, and how they are elaborated and polished to give the virtuoso performances of modern civilization. ECOLOGICAL INTELLIGENCE Ever since the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget likened children to little scientists, psychologists have compared the person in the street, young and old, to the person in the lab.

At that moment a woman standing next to me exclaimed, "How could anyone see this and not believe in God!" We agreed a priori on the facts that need to be explained, though we disagreed about how to explain them. Well before Darwin, theologians such as William Paley pointed to the engineering marvels of nature as proof of the existence of God. Darwin did not invent the facts to be explained, only the explanation. But what, exactly, are we all so impressed by?

But the intuition that eyes and spiders show "design" and that rocks and Orion dont can be unpacked into explicit criteria.

Natural selection is hobbled by shortsightedness, the dead hand of the past, and crippling constraints on what kinds of structures are biologically and physically possible. Unlike a human engineer, selection is incapable of good design. Animals are clunking jalopies saddled with ancestral junk and occasionally blunder into barely serviceable solutions. People are so eager to believe this claim that they seldom think it through or check the facts. Where do we find this miraculous human engineer who is not constrained by availability of parts, manufacturing practicality, and the laws of physics? Of course, natural selection does not have the foresight of engineers, but that cuts both ways: it does not have their mental blocks, impoverished imagination, or conformity to bourgeois sensibilities and ruling-class interests, either. Guided only by what works, selection can home in on brilliant, creative solutions. For millennia, biologists have discovered to their astonishment and delight the ingenious contrivances of the living world: the biomechanical perfection of cheetahs, the infrared pinhole cameras of snakes, the sonar of bats, the superglue of barnacles, the steel-strong silk of spiders, the dozens of grips of the human hand, the DNA repair machinery in all complex organisms. After all, entropy and more malevolent forces like predators and parasites are constantly gnawing at an organisms right to life and do not forgive slapdash engineering. And many of the examples of bad design in the animal kingdom turn out to be old spouses tales. Take the remark in a book by a famous cognitive psychologist that natural selection has been powerless to eliminate the wings of any bird, which is why penguins are stuck with wings even though they cannot fly. Wrong twice. The moa had no trace of a wing, and penguins do use their wings to fly under water. Michael French makes the point in his engineering textbook using a more famous example: It is an old joke that a camel is a horse designed by a committee, a joke which does grave injustice to a splendid creature and altogether too 168 J much honour to the creative power of committees. For a camel is no chimera, no odd collection of bits, but an elegant design of the tightest unity. So far as we can judge, every part is contrived to suit the difficult role of the whole, a large herbivorous animal to live in harsh climates with much soft going, sparse vegetation and very sparse water. The specification for a camel, if it were ever written down, would be a tough one in terms of range, fuel economy and adaptation to difficult terrains and extreme temperatures, and we must not be surprised that the design that meets it appears extreme. Nevertheless, every feature of the camel is of a piece: the large feet to diffuse load, the knobbly knees that derive from some of the design principles of Chapter 7 [bearings and pivots], the hump for storing food and the characteristic profile of the lips have a congruity that derives from function and invests the whole creation with a feeling of style and a certain bizarre elegance, borne out by the beautiful', 'the organized complexity of '),

The reflectance specialist bears all the responsibility for duplicating the The Minds Eye 255 image, and it just paints it in. The program thinks it is looking at a painting. Once the program has a chance to adjust its guesses, it settles into the interpretation shown in the middle row. The shape specialist finds the most regular 3-D shape (shown in side view in the left column): square panels joined at right angles. The lighting specialist finds that by shining the light from above, it can make the play of shadows look something like the image. Finally the reflectance specialist touches up the model with paint. The four columns zigzag 3- D shape, lighting from above, shadow in the middle, light stripe next to a darker one correspond to how people interpret the original image. Does the program do anything else reminiscent of humans? Remember how the fanfold flips in depth like a Necker cube. The outer fold becomes an inner one, and vice versa. The program, in a way, can see the flip, too; the flipped interpretation is shown in the bottom row. The program assigned the same costs to the two interpretations and arrived at one or the other randomly. When people see a 3-D shape flip, they usually see the direction of the light source flip, too: top fold out, light from above; bottom fold out, light from below. The program does the same. Unlike a person, the program does not actually flip between the two interpretations, but if Adelson and Pentland had had the specialists pass around their guesses in a constraint network (like the Necker cube network on p. 107 or the stereo vision model), rather than in an assembly line, it might have done so. The workshop parable clarifies the idea that the mind is a collection of modules, a system of organs, or a society of experts. Experts are needed because expertise is needed: the minds problems are too technical and specialized to be solved by a jack-of-all-trades. And most of the information needed by one expert is irrelevant to another and would only interfere with its job. But working in isolation, an expert can consider too many solutions or doggedly pursue an unlikely one; at some point the experts must confer. The many experts are trying to make sense of a single world, and that world is indifferent to their travails, neither offering easy solutions nor going out of its way to befuddle. So a supervisory scheme should aim to keep the experts within a budget in which improbable guesses are more expensive. That forces them to cooperate in assembling the most likely overall guess about the state of the world. 256 SEEING IN TWO AND A HALF DIMENSIONS Once the experts have completed their work, what do they post on the blackboard that the rest of the brain accesses? If we could somehow show the visual field from a rest-of-the-brains-eye view, like the hypothetical camera behind the eye of the Terminator, what would it look like? The very question may sound like a thick-witted little-man-in-the-head fallacy, but it is not. It is about the information in one of the brain s data representations and the form the information takes. Indeed, taking the question seriously sends a bracing shock to our naive intuitions about the minds eye.

The persons body is used as the asymmetrical frame of reference that makes the distinction between a shape and its mirror image logically possible. The Minds Eye 279 Now, Cooper and Shepards subjects may have been doing the same thing, except that they were rotating the shape in their minds instead of in the world. To decide whether they were seeing a normal or a backwards R, they mentally rotated an image of the shape until it was upright, and then judged whether the imaginary loop was on their right side or their left side. So Cooper and Shepard have demonstrated that the mind can rotate objects, and they have demonstrated that one aspect of an objects intrinsic shape its handedness is not stored in a 3-D geon model. But for all its fascination, handedness is such a peculiar feature of the universe that we cannot conclude much about shape recognition in general from the experiments on mental rotation. For all we know, the mind could overlay objects with a 3-D reference frame (for geon matching), specified up to, but not including, which way to put the arrow on the side-toside axis. As they say, more research is needed. The psychologist Michael Tarr and I did some more research. We created our own little world of shapes and despotically controlled peoples exposure to them, aiming at clean tests of the three hypotheses on the table. J . The shapes were similar enough that people could not use shortcuts like a telltale squiggle. None was a mirror image of any other, so we would not get sidetracked by the peculiarities of the world in the looking glass. Each shape had a giveaway little foot, so people would never have a problem finding the top and the bottom. We gave each person three shapes to learn, and then asked them to identify the shapes by pressing one of three buttons whenever a shape flashed on a computer screen. Each shape appeared at a few orientations over and over. For example, Shape 3 might appear with its top at four oclock hundreds of times, and with its top at seven oclock hundreds of times. (All the shapes and tilts were mixed up in a random order.) People thus had the opportunity to learn what each shape looked like in a few views. 280 J Finally, we hit them with a flurry of new trials in which every shape appeared at twenty-four evenly spaced orientations (again randomly ordered). We wanted to see how people dealt with the old shapes at the new orientations. Every button-press was timed to the thousandth of a second. According to the multiple-view theory, people should create a separate memory file for every orientation in which an object commonly appeared. For example, they would set up a file showing what Shape 3 looks like right-side up (which is how they learned it), and then a second file for what it looks like at four oclock and a third for seven oclock. The people should soon recognize Shape 3 at these orientations very quickly. When we then surprised them with the same shapes at new orientations, however, they should take much longer, because they would have to interpolate a new view between the familiar ones to accommodate it. The new orientations should all take an extra increment of time. According to the mental-rotation theory, people should be quick to recognize the shape when it is upright, and slower and slower the farther it has been misoriented.

My dolly is scrunched from someonebut not from me. They had to stop from a red light. The children could not have inherited the metaphors from earlier speakers; the equation of space with abstract ideas has come naturally to them. Space and force are so basic to language that they are hardly metaphors at all, at least not in the sense of the literary devices used in poetry and prose. There is no way to talk about possession, circumstance, and time in ordinary conversation without using words like going, keeping, and being at. And the words dont trigger the sense of incongruity that drives a genuine literary metaphor. We all know when we are faced with a figure of speech. As Jackendoff points out, its natural to say, "Of course, the world isnt really a stage, but if it were, you might say that infancy is the first act." But it would be bizarre to say, "Of course, meetings arent really points in motion, but if they were, you might say that this one went from 3:00 to 4:00." Models of space and force dont act like figures of speech intended to convey new insights; they seem closer to the medium of thought itself. I suspect that parts of our mental equipment for time, animate beings, minds, and social relations were copied and modified in the course of our evolution from the module for intuitive physics that we partly share with chimpanzees. Metaphors can be built out of metaphors, and we continue to borrow from concrete thoughts when we stretch our ideas and words to encompass new domains. Somewhere between the basic constructions for space and time in English and the glories of Shakespeare there is a vast inventory of everyday metaphors that express the bulk of our experience. George Lakoff and the linguist Mark Johnson have assembled a list of the "metaphors we live by" mental equations that embrace dozens of expressions: ARGUMENT IS WAR: Your claims are indefensible. He attacked every weak point in my argument. 358 J Her criticisms were right on target. Ive never won an argument with him. VIRTUE IS UP: He is high-minded. She is an upstanding citizen.

Ideas are not only food but buildings, people, plants, products, commodities, money, tools, and fashions. Love is a force, madness, magic, and war. The visual field is a container, self-esteem is a brittle object, time is money, life is a game of chance. T h e ubiquity of metaphor brings us closer to a resolution to Wallaces paradox.

The heroine is done in by a progressive disease, not a heart attack or a piece of hot dog stuck in the throat, so we can prepare our emotions for the tragedy. We only have to accept the abstract premise that the heroine will die; we are excused from witnessing the disagreeable details. (Greta Garbo, Ali MacGraw, and Debra Winger all looked quite lovely as they wasted away from consumption and cancer.) And the viewer must identify with the next of kin, empathize with their struggle to cope, and feel confident that life will go on. Tearjerkers simulate a triumph over tragedy. Even following the foibles of ordinary virtual people as they live their lives can press a pleasure button, the one labeled "gossip." Gossip is a favorite pastime in all human societies because knowledge is power. Knowing who needs a favor and who is in a position to offer one, who is trustworthy and who is a liar, who is available (or soon to become available) and who is under the protection of a jealous spouse or family all give obvious strategic advantages in the games of life. That is especially The Meaning of Life 541 true when the information is not yet widely known and one can be the first to exploit an opportunity, the social equivalent of insider trading. In the small bands in which our minds evolved, everyone knew everyone else, so all gossip was useful. Today, when we peer into the private lives of fictitious characters, we are giving ourselves the same buzz. Literature, though, not only delights but instructs. The computer scientist Jerry Hobbs has tried to reverse-engineer the fictional narrative in an essay he was tempted to call "Will Robots Ever Have Literature?" Novels, he concluded, work like experiments. The author places a fictitious character in a hypothetical situation in an otherwise real world where ordinary facts and laws hold, and allows the reader to explore the consequences. We can imagine that there was a person in Dublin named Leopold Bloom with the personality, family, and occupation that James Joyce attributed to him, but we would object if we were suddenly to learn that the British sovereign at the time was not King Edward but Queen Edwina. Even in science fiction, we are asked to suspend belief in a few laws of physics, say to get the heroes to the next galaxy, but the events should otherwise unfold according to lawful causes and effects. A surreal story like Kafkas Metamorphosis begins with one counterfactual premise a man can turn into an insect and plays out the consequences in a world where everything else is the same. The hero retains his human consciousness, and we follow him as he makes his way and people react to him as real people would react to a giant insect. Only in fiction that is about logic and reality, such as Alices Adventures in Wonderland, can any strange thing happen. Once the fictitious world is set up, the protagonist is given a goal and we watch as he or she pursues it in the face of obstacles. It is no coincidence that this standard definition of plot is identical to the definition of intelligence I suggested in Chapter 2. Characters in a fictitious world do exactly what our intelligence allows us to do in the real world.

(327, 151, 3, 'the tunability of binocular vision in different species offers a new way of thinking about learning in general. Learning is often described as indispensable shaper of amorphous brain tissue Instead it might be an innate adaptation to the project-scheduling demands of a self-assembling animal. The genome builds as much of the animal as it can, and for the parts of the animal that cannot be specified in advance (such as the proper wiring for two eyes that are moving apart at an unpredictable rate), the genome turns on an information-gathering mechanism at the time in development at which it is most needed. In The Language Instinct I develop a similar explanation for the critical period for learning language in childhood. I have led you through magic-eye stereograms not just because it is fun to understand how the magic works. I think stereo vision is one of the glories of nature and a paradigm of how other parts of the mind might work. Stereo vision is information processing that we experience as a particular flavor of consciousness, a connection between mental computation and awareness that is so lawful that computer programmers can manipulate it to enchant millions. It is a module in several senses: it works without the rest of the mind (not needing recognizable objects), the rest of the mind works without it (getting by, if it has to, with other depth analyzers), it imposes particular demands on the wiring of the brain, and it depends on principles specific to its problem (the geometry of binocular parallax). Though stereo vision develops in childhood and is sensitive to experience, it is not insightfully described as "learned" or as "a mixture of nature and nurture"; the development is part of an assembly schedule and the sensitivity to experience is a circumscribed intake of information by a structured system. Stereo vision shows off the engineering acumen of natural selection, exploiting subtle theorems in optics rediscovered millions of years later by the likes of Leonardo da Vinci, 242 Kepler, Wheatstone, and aerial reconnaissance engineers. It evolved in response to identifiable selection pressures in the ecology of our ancestors. And it solves unsolvable problems by making tacit assumptions about the world that were true when we evolved but are not always true now. LIGHTING, SHADING. SHAPING Stereo vision is part of a crucial early stage of vision that figures out the depths and materials of surfaces, but it is not the only part. Seeing in three dimensions doesnt require two eyes. You can get a rich sense of shape and substance from the meagerest hints in a picture. Look at these drawings, designed by the psychologist Edward Adelson. The left one appears to be white cardboard with a gray vertical stripe, folded horizontally and lit from above. The right one appears to be white cardboard with a gray horizontal stripe, folded vertically and lit from the side. (If you stare long enough, either might flip in depth, like a Necker cube; lets ignore that for now.) But the ink on the page (and the projection on your retina) is virtually the same in the two pictures. F.ach is a zigzag tic-tac-toe box with some of the squares shaded in. In both drawings, the comer squares are white, the top and side squares are light gray, and the middle square is a darker gray. Somehow the combination of shading and zigzagging pops them into the third dimension and colorizes each square, but in different ways. The borders labeled "1" are physically the same in the two drawings. But in the left drawing the border looks', 'the tunability of binocular '),

If animals breathe, and horses are animals, then horses breathe; if horses have hooves, and Mr. Ed is a horse, then Mr. Ed has hooves. This can lure a modeler into treating an individual as a very, very specific subclass, using some slight difference between the two entities a freckle unit that is on for one individual but off for the other to distinguish neardoppelgangers. Like many connectionist proposals, the idea dates back to British associationism. Berkeley wrote, "Take away the sensations of softness, moisture, redness, tartness, and you take away the cherry, since it is not a being distinct from sensations. A cherry, I say, is nothing but a congeries of sensible impressions." But Berkeleys suggestion never did work. Your knowledge of the properties of two objects can be identical and still you can know they are distinct. Imagine a room with two identical chairs. Someone comes in and switches them around. Is the room the same as or different from before? Obviously, everyone understands that it is different. But you know of no feature that distinguishes one chair from the other except that you can think of one as Chair Number One and the other as Chair Number Two. We are back to arbitrary labels for memory slots, as in the despised digital computer! The same point underlies a joke from the comedian Stephen Wright: "While I was gone, someone stole everything in my apartment and replaced it 116 with an exact replica. When I told my roommate, he said, Do I know you?" There is, admittedly, one feature that always distinguishes individuals: they cannot be in the same place at the same time. Perhaps the mind could stamp every object with the time and place and constantly update those coordinates, allowing it to distinguish individuals with identical properties. But even that fails to capture our ability to keep individuals apart in our minds. Suppose an infinite white plane contains nothing but two identical circles. One of them slides over and superimposes itself on the second one for a few moments, then proceeds on its way. I dont think anyone has trouble conceiving of the circles as distinct entities even in the moments in which they are in the same place at the same time.

In the sound wave arriving at our ears, syllables and words are warped and smeared together, but we dont i hear that seamless acoustic ribbon; we "hear" a chain of well-demar- I cated words.

The highest levels the contents of the world, or the gist of a message tend to stick in long-term memory days and years after an experience, but as the experience is unfolding, we are aware of the sights and sounds. We do not just abstractly think "Face!" when we see a face; the shadings and contours are available for scrutiny. 140 The advantages of intermediate-level awareness are not hard to find. Our perception of a constant shape and lightness across changes in viewing conditions tracks the objects inherent properties: the lump of coal itself stays rigid and black as we move around it or raise the lights, and we experience it as looking the same. The lower levels are not needed, and the higher levels are not enough. The raw data and computational steps behind these constancies are sealed off from our awareness, no doubt because they use the eternal laws of optics and neither need advice from, nor have any insights to offer to, the rest of cognition. The products of the computation are released for general consumption well before the identities of objects are established, because we need more than a terse mise en scene to make our way around the world. Behavior is a game of inches, and the geometry and composition of surfaces must be available to the decision processes that plan the next step or grasp. Similarly, while we are understanding a sentence there is nothing to be gained in peering all the way down to the hisses and hums of the sound wave; they have to be decoded into syllables before they match up with anything meaningful in the mental dictionary.

The choice of words and the tone of voice carry information that allows us to hear between the lines. The next noteworthy feature of conscious access is the spotlight of attention. It serves as the quintessential demonstration that unconscious parallel processing (in which many inputs are processed at the same time, each by its own mini-processor) can go only so far. An early stage of parallel processing does what it can, and passes along a representation from which a more cramped and plodding processor must select the information it needs. The psychologist Anne Treisman thought up a few simple, now classic demonstrations of where unconscious processing leaves off and conscious processing begins. People are shown a display of colored shapes, like Xs and Os, and are asked to press a button if they see a specified target. If the search target is an O and the display shows one O in a sea of Xs, the person responds quickly. It doesnt matter how many Xs there are; people say the O just pops out.

Its not to adapt to environmental change, because a random change in an already adapted organism is more likely to be for the worse than for the better, there being vastly more ways to be badly adapted than to be well adapted. The best theory, proposed by John Tooby, William Hamilton, and others, and now supported by several kinds of evidence, is that sex is a defense against parasites and pathogens (disease- causing microorganisms). From a germs point of view, you are a big yummy mound of cheesecake, there for the eating. Your body takes a different view, and has evolved a battery of defenses, from your skin to your immune system, to keep them out or do them in. An evolutionary arms race goes on between hosts and pathogens, though a better analogy might be an escalating contest between lockpickers and locksmiths. Germs are small, and they evolve diabolical tricks for infiltrating and hijacking the machinery of the cells, for skimming off its raw materials, and for passing themselves off as the bodys own tissues to escape the surveillance of the immune system. The body responds with better security systems, but the germs have a built-in advantage: there are more of them and they can breed millions of times faster, which makes them evolve faster. They can evolve substantially within the lifetime of a host. Whatever molecular locks the body has evolved, the pathogens can evolve keys to open them. Now, if an organism is asexual, once the pathogens crack the safe of its body they also have cracked the safes of its children and siblings. Sexual reproduction is a way of changing the locks once a generation. By swapping half the genes out for a different half, an organism gives its offspring a head start in the race against the local germs. Its molecular locks have a different combination of pins, so the germs have to start evolving new keys from scratch. A malevolent pathogen is the one thing in the world that rewards change for changes sake. Sex poses a second puzzle. Why do we come in two sexes? Why do we make one big egg and lots of little sperm, instead of two equal blobs that coalesce like mercury? It is because the cell that is to become the baby cannot be just a bag of genes; it needs the metabolic machinery of the Family Values 463 rest of a cell. Some of that machinery, the mitochondria, has its own genes, the famous mitochondrial DNA which is so useful in dating evolutionary splits. Like all genes, the ones in mitochondria are selected to replicate ruthlessly. And that is why a cell formed by fusing two equal cells faces trouble. The mitochondria of one parent and the mitochondria of the other parent wage a ferocious war for survival inside it. Mitochondria from each parent will murder their counterparts from the other, leaving the fused cell dangerously underpowered. The genes for the rest of the cell (the ones in the nucleus) suffer from the crippling of the cell, so they evolve a way of heading off the internecine warfare. In each pair of parents, one "agrees" to unilateral disarmament. It contributes a cell that provides no metabolic machinery, just naked DNA for the new nucleus. The species reproduces by fusing a big cell that contains a halfset of genes plus all the necessary machinery with a small cell that contains a half-set of genes and nothing else.

(331, 155, 3, 'them for their offspring as milk. Birds and mammals invest calories, time, risk, and bodily wear and tear on their offspring, and are repaid in increases in the offsprings life expectancy. In theory, a parent could go to the other extreme and care for its firstborn all its life say, by suckling it until the parent died of old age. But that would make little sense because at some point the calories being turned into milk could better be invested in bearing and suckling a new offspring. As the first-born grows, each additional pint of milk is less and less crucial to its survival, and it becomes better and better equipped to find its own food. A younger offspring becomes a better investment, and the parent should wean the older one. A parent should transfer investment from an older child to a younger one when the benefit to the younger exceeds the cost to the older. The reckoning is based on the fact that the two children are equally related to the parent. But these calculations are from the parents point of view; the first child sees it differently. He shares fifty percent of his genes with his younger sibling, but he shares one hundred percent of his genes with himself. As far as he is concerned, the parent should continue to invest in him until the benefit to a younger sibling is greater than twice the cost to him. The genetic interests of the parent and the child diverge. Each child should want more parental care than the parent is willing to give, because parents want to invest in all of their offspring equally (relative to their needs), whereas each child wants more of the investment for himself. The tension is called parent-offspring conflict. In essence it is sibling rivalry: siblings compete among themselves for their parents investment, whereas the parents would be happiest if each accepted a share proportional to his or her needs. But sibling rivalry can be played out with parents, too. In evolutionary terms, the only reason a parent 442 withholds investment from one offspring is to save it for future ones. An offsprings conflict with its parents is really a rivalry with unborn Siblings. A tangible example is weaning conflict. The calories a mother converts to milk are not available to grow a new offspring, so nursing suppresses ovulation. At some point mammalian mothers wean their young so their bodies can prepare for bearing a subsequent offspring; When they do, the young mammal puts up a holy stink, hounding the mother for access to the teat for weeks or months before acquiescing. When I mentioned the theory of parent-offspring conflict to console a colleague whose two-year-old son had become a pest after the birth of a younger brother, he snapped, "All youre saying is that people are selfish!" Sleepless for weeks, he could be forgiven for missing the point. Clearly, parents arent selfish; parents are the least selfish entities in the known universe. But they arent infinitely selfless either, or every whine and tantrum would be music to their ears. And the theory predicts that children arent completely selfish, either. If they were, they would murder each newborn sibling to free up all the parents investment for themselves and would demand to be breast-fed all their lives. The reason they dont is that they are partly related to their present and future siblings.

(332, 156, 3, 'them or their genes their genes give them thoughts and feelings that were adaptive in the environment in which the genes were selected. I he other extension of adaptation is the seemingly innocuous cliche that "cultural evolution has taken over from biological evolution." For millions of years, genes were transmitted from body to body and were selected to confer adaptations on organisms. But after humans emerged, units of culture were transmitted from mind to mind and were selected to confer adaptations on cultures. The torch of progress has been passed to a swifter runner. In 2001: A Space Odyssey, a hairy arm hurls a bone into the air, and it fades into a space station. The premise of cultural evolution is that there is a single phenomenon the march of progress, the ascent of man, apes to Armageddon that Darwin explained only up to a point. My own view is that human brains evolved by one set of laws, those of natural selection and genetics, and now interact with one another according to other sets of laws, those of cognitive and social psychology, human ecology, and history. The reshaping of the skull and the rise and fall of empires may have little in common. Richard Dawkins has drawn the clearest analogy between the selection of genes and the selection of bits of culture, which he clubbed memes. Memes such as tunes, ideas, and stories spread from brain to brain and sometimes mutate in the transmission. New features of a meme that make its recipients more likely to retain and disseminate it, such as being catchy, seductive, funny, or irrefutable, will lead to the memes becoming more common in the meme pool. In subsequent rounds of retelling, the most spreadworthy memes will spread the most and will eventually take over the population. Ideas will therefore evolve to become better adapted to spreading themselves. Note that we are talking about ideas evolving to become more spreadable, not people evolving to become more knowledgeable. Dawkins himself used the analogy to illustrate how natural selection pertains to anything that can replicate, not just DNA. Others treat it as a Revenge of the Nerds 209 genuine theory of cultural evolution. Taken literally, it predicts that cultural evolution works like this. A meme impels its bearer to broadcast it, and it mutates in some recipient: a sound, a word, or a phrase is randomly altered. Perhaps, as in Monty Pythons Life of Brian, the audience of the Sermon on the Mount mishears "Blessed are the peacemakers" as "Blessed are the cheesemakers." The new version is more memorable and comes to predominate in the majority of minds. It too is mangled by typos and speakos and hearos, and the most spreadable ones accumulate, gradually transforming the sequence of sounds. Eventually they spell out, "Thats one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind." I think youll agree that this is not how cultural change works. A complex meme does not arise from the retention of copying errors. It arises because some person knuckles down, racks his brain, musters his ingenuity, and composes or writes or paints or invents something. Granted, the fabricator is influenced by ideas in the air, and may polish draft after draft, but neither of these progressions is like natural selection. Just compare the input and the output draft five and draft six, or an artists inspiration and her oeuvre. They do not differ by a few random substitutions.

A carcass is jealously guarded by its hunter or an animal fierce enough to have stolen it. It is attractive to microorganisms, who quickly poison the meat to repel other would-be scavengers. So when modern primates or hunter-gatherers come across a carcass, they usually leave it alone. In a poster widely available in head shops in the early 1970s, one vulture says to the other, "Patience, my ass! Im going to kill something." The poster got it right, except for the vulture part: mammals that do scavenge, such as hyenas, also hunt. Meat is also a major currency of our social life. Imagine a cow who tries to win the favors of a neighbor by dropping a clump of grass at its feet. One could forgive the second cow for thinking, "Thanks, but I can get my own grass." The nutritional jackpot of a felled animal is another matter. Miss Piggy once advised, "Never eat anything bigger than you can lift." A hunter with a dead animal larger than he can eat and about to become a putrefying mass is faced with a unique opportunity. Hunting is largely a matter of luck. In the absence of refrigeration, a good place to store meat for leaner times is in the bodies of other hunters who will return the favor when fortunes reverse. This eases the way for the male coalitions and the extensive reciprocity that are ubiquitous in foraging societies. And there are other markets for a hunters surplus. Having concentrated food to offer ones offspring changes the relative payoffs for males between investing in their young and competing with other males for access to females. The robin bringing a worm to the nestlings reminds us Revenge of the Nerds 197 that most animals that provision their young do so with prey, the only food that repays the effort to obtain it and transport it. Meat also figures into sexual politics. In all foraging societies, presumably including our ancestors, hunting is overwhelmingly a male activity. Women are encumbered with children, which makes hunting inconvenient, and men are bigger and more adept at killing because of their evolutionary history of killing each other. As a result, males can invest surplus meat in their children by provisioning the childrens pregnant or nursing mothers. They also can trade meat with females for plant foods or for sex. Brazen bartering of the carnal for the carnal has been observed in baboons and chimpanzees and is common in foraging peoples. Though people in modern societies are ever-so-more discreet, an exchange of resources for sexual access is still an important part of the interactions between men and women all over the world. (Chapter 7 explores these dynamics and how they originated in differences in reproductive anatomy, though of course anatomy is not destiny in modern ways of life.) In any case, we have not lost the association completely. Miss Manners Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior advises: There are three possible parts to a date, of which at least two must be " offered: entertainment, food, and affection. It is customary to begin a series of dates with a great deal of entertainment, a moderate amount of food, and the merest suggestion of affection. As the amount of affection increases, the entertainment can be reduced proportionately. When the affection is the entertainment, we no longer call it dating. Under no circumstances can the food be omitted. Of course no one really', 'they can scan large '),
(334, 158, 3, 'They note that the different engineering demands on a memory system are often at cross-purposes. Natural selection, they argue, responded by giving organisms specialized memory systems. Each has a computational structure optimized for the demands of one of the tasks the mind of the animal must fulfill. For example, birds that cache seeds to retrieve in leaner times have evolved a capacious memory for the hiding places (ten thousand places, in the case of the Clarks Nutcracker). Birds whose males sing to impress the females or to intimidate other males have evolved a capacious memory for songs (two hundred, in the case of the nightingale). The1 memory for caches and the memory for songs are in different brain structures and have different patterns of wiring. We humans place two very different demands on our memory system at the same time. We have to remember individual episodes of who did what to whom, when, where, and why, and that requires stamping each episode with a time, a date, and a serial number. But we also must extract generic knowledge about how people work and how the world works. Sherry and Schacter suggest that nature gave us one memory system for each requirement: an "episodic" or autobiographical memory, and a "semantic" or genericknowledge memory, following a distinction first made by the psychologist Endel Tulving. The trick that multiplies human thoughts into truly astronomical numbers is not the slotting of concepts into three or four roles but a kind of mental fecundity called recursion. A fixed set of units for each role is not enough. We humans can take an entire proposition and give it a role in some larger proposition. Then we can take the larger proposition and embed it in a still-larger one, creating a hierarchical tree structure of propositions inside propositions. Not only did the baby eat the slug, but the father saw the baby eat the slug, and I wonder whether the father saw the baby eat the slug, and the father knows that I wonder whether he saw the baby eat the slug, and I can guess that the father knows that I wonder whether he saw the baby eat the slug, and so on. Just as an abilThinking Machines 125 ity to add 1 to a number bestows the ability to generate an infinite set of numbers, the ability to embed a proposition inside another proposition bestows the ability to think an infinite number of thoughts. To get propositions-inside-propositions out of the network displayed in the preceding diagram, one could add a new layer of connections to the top of the diagram, connecting the bank of units for the whole proposition to the role slot in some bigger proposition; the role might be something like "event-observed." If we continue to add enough layers, we could accommodate an entire multiply nested proposition by etching a full tree diagram for it in connectoplasm. But this solution is clumsy and raises suspicions. For every kind of recursive structure, there would have to be a different network hard-wired in: one network for a person thinking about a proposition, another for a person thinking about a proposition about a person thinking about a proposition, a third for a person communicating a proposition about some person to another person, and so on. > In computer science and psycholinguistics, a more powerful and flexible mechanism is used.

Usually people do not want any suitor who wants them too badly too early, because it shows that the suitor is desperate (so they should wait for someone better), and because it shows that the suitors ardor is too easily triggered (hence too easily triggerable by someone else). The contradiction of courtship flaunt your desire while playing hard to get comes from the two parts of romantic love: setting a minimal standard for candidates in the mate market, and capriciously committing body and soul to one of them. THE SOCIETY OF FEELINGS Mental life often feels like a parliament within. Thoughts and feelings vie for control as if each were an agent with strategies for taking over the whole person, you. Might our mental agents use paradoxical tactics with one another handcuffs, doomsday machines, unbreakable contracts with third parties? The analogy is imperfect because natural selection designs people to compete but does not design organs, including mental agents, to compete; the interests of the whole person are paramount. But the whole person has many goals, like food, sex, and safety, and that requires a division of labor among mental agents with different priorities and kinds of expertise. The agents are bound by an entente that benefits the whole person over a lifetime, but over the short term the agents may outwit one another with devious tactics. Self-control is unmistakably a tactical battle between parts of the mind. Schelling observes that the tactics people use to control them420 I selves are interchangeable with the tactics they use to control; others. How do you prevent your child from scratching his hives in hi$ sleep? Put mittens on him. How do you prevent yourself from scratching your hives in your sleep? Put mittens on yourself. If Odysseus had not plugged his shipmates ears, they would have done it on their own. The self that wants a trim body outwits the self that wants dessert by throwing out the brownies at the opportune moment when it is in control. So we do seem to use paradoxical tactics against ourselves. The agent in control at one time makes a voluntary but irreversible sacrifice of freedom of choice for the whole body, and gets its way in the long run. That is the bright spot in this whole depressing discussion of selfish genes and doomsday machines. Social life is not always the equivalent of global thermonuclear war because the part of us with the longest view of the future, when in control of the body, can voluntarily sacrifice freedom of choice for the body at other times. We sign contracts, submit to laws, and hitch our reputations to public declarations of loyalty to friends and mates. These are not tactics to defeat someone else, but tactics to defeat the darker parts of ourselves. One more speculation on the battle inside the head. No one knows what, if anything, grief is for. Obviously the loss of a loved one is unpleasant, but why should it be devastating? Why the debilitating pain that stops people from eating, sleeping, resisting diseases, and getting on with life? Jane Goodall describes a young chimp, Flint, who after the death of his beloved mother became depressed and died himself as if of a broken heart. Some have suggested that grief is an enforced interlude for reassessment. Life will never be the same, so one must take time to plan how to cope with a world that has been turned upside down.

But a male who impregnates his sister or daughter could be adding to the number of offspring he sires, because her pregnancy does not foreclose his impregnating someone else. There is a risk that the child will be deformed, but if it isnt, the child is a sheer bonus (more accurately, the extra dose of his genes in that child are the bonus). 458 Incest repugnance might be weaker, making him more likely to cross the line. It is a special case of the lower costs of reproduction for males and their less discriminating sexual desire, to which we will return. A father, moreover, can never be certain that a daughter is his, so the genetic cost to him could be zero. That could weaken the suppression of desire even further compared to her brother, who is certain to be related to his sister because they share a mother. For stepfathers and stepbrothers, there is no genetic cost at all. It is no surprise, then, that between half and three-quarters of all reported incest cases are between stepfathers and stepdaughters, most of them initiated by the stepfather. Most of the rest are between fathers and daughters, and virtually all are coerced by the father. Some are between girls and other older male relatives, also mostly coerced. A mother gets no genetic benefit from a mating between her husband and her daughter (compared with a mating between her daughter and a son-in-law), but suffers the cost of defective grandchildren, so her interests are aligned with her daughters and she should be a force opposing incest. Incestuous exploitation of girls might be even more common if their mothers were not around. These battles are driven by strong emotions, but the emotions are not an alternative to the genetic analysis; the analysis explains why they exist. And of course, in science as in detective work, to try to figure out the motive for a crime is not to excuse the crime. People cannot directly sense their genetic overlap with another person; as with the rest of perception, the brain must combine information from the senses with assumptions about the world to make an intelligent guess. Chapter 4 showed that when the world violates the assumptions, we fall prey to an illusion, and that is exactly what happens in the perception of kinship. The nineteenth-century anthropologist Edward Westermarck conjectured that growing up in intimate closeness with a person in the early years is the key information the brain uses to put the person in the category "sibling." Similarly, when an adult raises a child the adult should perceive the child as "son" or "daughter" and the child should perceive the adult as "mother" or "father." The classifications then negate sexual desire. These algorithms presuppose a world in which children who are raised together are biological siblings and vice versa. That is certainly true of foraging peoples. A mothers children grow up with her and usually with their father, too. When the assumption is false, people should be the victim of a kinship illusion. If they grow up with a person who is Family Values 459 not a relative, they should be sexually indifferent or repelled. If they do not grow up with a person who is a relative, they should fail to be repelled.

As Trivers notes, babies cannot fling their mothers to the ground and nurse at will; they have to use psychological tactics. A baby has to manipulate its parents genuine concern for its welfare to induce them to give more than they would otherwise be willing to give. Since parents can learn to ignore cries of "wolf," the tactics have to be more insidious. An infant knows its own condition better than a parent does, because the infants brain is connected to sensors throughout its body. Both the parent and the infant have an interest in the parents responding to the infants needs, such as by feeding it when it is hungry and cuddling it when it is cold. That gives the infant an opening to elicit more care than the parent wants to give. The baby can cry when it is not so cold or hungry, or withhold a smile until it gets its way. The baby need not literally be faking. Since parents should evolve to recognize sham crying, the babys most effective tactic might be to feel genuinely miserable, even when there is no biological need. Self-deception may begin early. The child can also resort to extortion by howling at night or throwing a tantrum in public, situations in which the parents are averse to letting the noise continue and are apt to capitulate. Worse, the parents interest in their childrens welfare allows the children to hold themselves hostage, say, by thrashing about in a violent tantrum or refusing to do something both parties know the child would enjoy. Thomas Schelling notes that children are in an excellent position to use paradoxical tactics (Chapter 6). They can cover their ears, scream, avoid their parents gaze, or regress, all of which prevent them from registering or understanding their parents threats. We get the evolution of the brat. 446 I he theory of parent-offspring conflict is an alternative to two popular ideas. One is Freuds Oedipal complex, the hypothesis that boys have an unconscious wish to have sex with their mothers and kill their fathers, and therefore fear that their fathers will castrate them. (Similarly, in the Electra complex, little girls want to have sex with their fathers.) There is indeed a fact to be explained. In all cultures, young children are sometimes possessive of their mothers and cool to the mothers consort. Parent- offspring conflict offers a straightforward explanation. Daddys interest in Mommy takes her attention away from me and, even worse, threatens to create a baby brother or sister. Children may well have evolved tactics for delaying that sad day by diminishing their mothers interest in sex and keeping their fathers away from her. It would be a straightforward extension of weaning conflict. The theory explains why so-called Oedipal feelings are as common in girls as in boys, and avoids the preposterous idea that little boys want to copulate with their mothers. Daly and Wilson, who proposed the alternative, believe that Freuds mistake was to run together two different kinds of parent-offspring conflict. Young children are in conflict with their father over access to their mother, but it is not a sexual rivalry. And older children may have a sexual conflict with their parents, especially their fathers, but it is not a rivalry over the mother.

Hinton and Nowlan submitted the results of their computer simulations to a journal and were told that they had been scooped by a hundred years. The psychologist James Mark Baldwin had proposed that learning could guide evolution in precisely this way, creating an illusion of Lamarckian evolution without there really being Lamarckian evolution. But no one had shown that the idea, known as the Baldwin effect, would really work. Hinton and Nowlan showed why it can. The ability to learn alters the evolutionary problem from looking for a needle in a haystack to looking for the needle with someone telling you when you are getting close. The Baldwin effect probably played a large role in the evolution of brains. Contrary to standard social science assumptions, learning is not some pinnacle of evolution attained only recently by humans. All but the simplest animals learn. That is why mentally uncomplicated creatures like fruit flies and sea slugs have been convenient subjects for neuroscientists searching for the neural incarnation of learning. If the ability to learn was in place in an early ancestor of the multicellular animals, it could have guided the evolution of nervous systems toward their specialized circuits even when the circuits are so intricate that natural selection could not have found them on its own. INSTINCT AND INTELLIGENCE Complex neural circuitry has evolved in many animals, but the common image of animals climbing up some intelligence ladder is wrong. The 180 J common view is that lower animals have a few fixed reflexes, and that in higher ones the reflexes can be associated with new stimuli (as in Pavlovs experiments) and the responses can be associated with rewards (as in Skinners). On this view, the ability to associate gets bettei- in still higher organisms, and eventually it is freed from bodily drives and physical stimuli and responses and can associate ideas directly to each other, reaching an apex in man. But the distribution of intelligence in real animals is nothing like this. The Tunisian desert ant leaves its nest, travels some distance, and then wanders over the burning sands looking for the carcass of an insect that has keeled over from the heat. When it finds one, it bites off a chunk, turns, and makes a beeline for the nest, a hole one millimeter in diameter as much as fifty meters away. How does it find its way back? The navigation depends on information gathered during the outward journey, not on sensing the nest like a beacon. If someone lifts the ant as it emerges from the nest and plunks it down some distance away, the ant wanders in random circles. If someone moves the ant after it finds food, it runs in a line within a degree or two of the direction of its nest with respect to the abduction site, slightly overshoots the point where the nest should be, does a quick U-turn, and searches for the nonexistent nest. This shows that the ant has somehow measured and stored the direction and distance back to the nest, a form of navigation called path integration or dead reckoning. This example of information processing in animals, discovered by the biologist Rudiger Wehner, is one of many that the psychologist Randy Gallistel has used to try to get people to stop thinking about learning as the formation of associations. He explains the principle: Path integration is the integration of the velocity vector with respect to time to obtain the position vector, or some discrete equivalent of this computation.

Beautiful wooden stereoscopes and the software for them (cards with side-by-side photographs) are still sold in antique stores to avid collectors. A modern version is the ViewMaster, available at tourist traps the world over: an inexpensive viewer that displays a ring of stereo slides of the local attractions. A different technique, the anaglyph, overlays the two images on one surface and uses clever tricks so that each eye sees only the image intended for it. A familiar example is the notorious red-and-green cardboard eyeglasses associated with the 3-D movie craze of the early 1950s. The left eyes image is projected in red and the right eyes image is projected in green onto a single white screen. The left eye peers at the screen through a green filter, which makes the white background look green and the green lines intended for the other eye invisible; the red lines intended for the left eye stand out as black. Similarly, the red filter over the right eye makes the background red, the red lines invisible, and the green lines black. Each eye gets its own image, and the Sludge Monsters from Alpha Centauri rise out of the screen. An unfortunate side effect is that when the two eyes see very different patterns like the red and green backgrounds, the brain cannot fuse them. It carves the visual field into a patchwork and seesaws between seeing each patch as green or red, a dis224 I concerting effect called binocular rivalry. You can experience a milder case by holding a finger a few inches in front of you with both eyes open gazing into the distance so you get a double image. If you pay attention to one of the double images, you will notice that portions slowly become opaque, dissolve into transparency, fill in again, and so on. A better kind of anaglyph puts polarizing filters, rather than colored filters, over two projector lenses and in the cardboard glasses. The image intended for the left eye is projected from the left projector in light waves that oscillate in a diagonal plane, like this: /. The light can pass through a filter in front of the left eye which has microscopic slits that are also in that orientation, but cannot pass through a filter in front of the right eye with slits in the opposite orientation, like this: \. Conversely, the filter in front of the right eye allows in only the light coming from the right projector. The superimposed images can be in color, and they do not incite rivalry between the eyes. The technique was used to excellent effect by Alfred Hitchcock in Dial "M" for Murder in the scene in which Grace Kelly reaches out for the scissors to stab her would-be strangler. The same cannot be said for the film adaptation of Cole Porters Kiss Me Kate, in which a dancer belts out "Too Darn Hot" on a coffee table while flinging scarves at the camera. Modern anaglyph glasses have panes made of liquid crystal displays (like the numbers on a digital watch) which act as silent, electrically controlled shutters. At any moment one shutter is transparent and the other is opaque, forcing the eyes to take turns at seeing a computer screen in front of them. The glasses are synchronized with the screen, which shows the left eyes image while the left shutter is open and the right eyes image while the right shutter is open.

The theory also predicts that men should be willing to fight collectively only if they are confident of victory and none of them knows in advance who will be injured or killed. If defeat is likely, its pointless to fight on. And if you bear more than your share of the risk say, if your platoonmates are exposing you to danger by looking out for their own hides its also pointless to fight on. These two principles shape the psychology of war. Among foragers, warring bands are usually factions of the same people and have the same kinds of weaponry, so the predictor of victory in our evolutionary past would have been sheer numbers. The side with more warriors was invincible, and the odds of victory could be estimated from the manpower on each side. The Yanomamo are obsessed with the size of their villages for just that reason, and they often form alliances or rethink secessions because they know that smaller villages are helpless in wars. Even in modern societies, a mob of people on your side is emboldening and a mob on the other side terrifying. Mustering a crowd is a common tactic for whipping up patriotism, and a mass demonstration can incite panic even in a militarily secure ruler. A major principle 516 J of battlefield strategy is to surround an enemy unit, making defeat look certain and causing panic and rout. Just as important is an equitable distribution of risk. A war party faces the problem of altruism par excellence. Every member has an incentive to cheat by keeping himself out of harms way and exposing the others to greater risk. Just as benevolent cooperation cannot evolve unless the favor-granter detects and punishes cheaters, aggressive cooperation cannot evolve unless the fighters detect and punish cowards or shirkers. Bravery and discipline are the obsessions of fighting men. They affect everything from a soldiers sense of whom he wants in his foxhole to the command structure that coerces soldiers into assuming risk equitably and that rewards bravery and punishes desertion. War is rare in the animal kingdom because animals, like humans, ought to be cowards unless they can enforce a multiparty contract to share the risks. Unlike ancestral humans, they did not have the cognitive machinery from which an enforcement calculator could easily evolve. Here is another peculiarity of the logic and psychology of war. A man should agree to stay in a coalition for as long as he does not know that he is about to die. He may know the odds, but he cannot know whether the spinner of death is slowing down at him. But at some point he may see it coming. He may glimpse an archer who has him in his sights, or detect an impending ambush, or notice that he has been sent on a suicide mission. At that point everything changes, and the only rational move is to desert. Of course, if the uncertainty collapses only seconds before death, its too late. The farther in advance a fighter can predict that he is about to become an unknown soldier, the more easily he can desert, and the more likely the coalition is to unravel. In a coalition of animals attacking another coalition or an individual, an attacker has some warning if he is being picked out for a counterattack, and can flee before they give chase. For that reason a coalition of animals would be especially prone to unraveling. But humans have invented weapons, from spears and arrows to bullets', 'true for most of '),

And they grasp the idea of "idea." For example, they know that you cant eat the memory of an apple and that a person can tell whats in a box only by looking into it. By four, children pass a very stringent test of knowledge about other minds: they can attribute to others beliefs they themselves know to be false. In a typical experiment, children open a Smarties box and are surprised to find pencils inside. (Smarties, the British psychologists explain to American audiences, are like M&Ms, only better.) Then the children are asked what a person coming into the room expects to find. Though the children know that the box contains pencils, they sequester the Good Ideas 331 knowledge, put themselves in the newcomers shoes, and say, "Smarties." Three-year-olds have more trouble keeping their knowledge out of the picture; they insist that the newcomer will expect to find pencils in the candy box. But its unlikely that they lack the very idea of other minds; when the wrong answer is made less alluring or the children are induced to think a bit harder, they attribute false beliefs to others, too. The results come out the same in every country in which children have been tested. Thinking of other minds comes so naturally that it almost seems like part and parcel of intelligence itself. Can we even imagine what it would be like not to think of other people as having minds? The psychologist Alison Gopnik imagines it would be like this: At the top of my field of vision is a blurry edge of nose, in front are waving handsAround me bags of skin are draped over chairs, and stuffed into pieces of cloth; they shift and protrude in unexpected ways.Two dark spots near the top of them swivel restlessly back and forth. A hole beneath the spots fills with food and from it comes a stream of noises.The noisy skin-bags suddenly [move] toward you, and their noises [grow] loud, and you [have] no idea why.Baron-Cohen, Alan Leslie, and Uta Frith have proposed that there really are people who think like this. They are the people we call autistic. Autism affects about one in a thousand children. They are said to "draw into a shell and live within themselves." When taken into a room, they disregard people and go for the objects. When someone offers a hand, they play with it like a mechanical toy. Cuddly dolls and stuffed animals hold little interest. They pay little attention to their parents and dont respond when called. In public, they touch, smell, and walk over people as if they were furniture. They dont play with other children. But the intellectual and perceptual abilities of some autistic children are legendary (especially after Dustin Hoffmans performance in Rain Man). Some of them learn multiplication tables, put together jigsaw puzzles (even upside down), disassemble and reassemble appliances, read distant license plates, or instantly calculate the day of the week on which any given date in the past or future falls. Like many psychology undergraduates, I learned about autism from a famous Scientific American reprint, "Joey: A Mechanical Boy," by the psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim. Bettelheim explained that Joeys autism was caused by emotionally distant parents ("icebox mother" became the 332 J favored term) and early, rigid toilet training. He wrote, "It is unlikely that Joeys calamity could befall a child in', 'Two-year-olds use mental verbs '),

Orthodontists 484 have found that a good-looking face has teeth and jaws in the optimal alignment for chewing. Luxuriant hair is always pleasing, possibly because it shows not only current health but a record of health in the years before. Malnutrition and disease weaken the hair as it grows from the scalp, leaving a fragile spot in the shaft. Long hair implies a long history of good health. A subtler sign of good genes is being average. Not average in attractiveness, of course, but average in the size and shape of every part of the face. The average measurement of a trait in a local population is a good estimate of the optimal design favored by natural selection. If people form a composite of the opposite-sex faces around them, they would have an ideal of the fittest mate against which any candidate could be matched. The exact facial geometry of the local race or ethnic group would not need to be built in. In fact, composite faces, whether formed by superimposing negatives in an enlarger or by sophisticated computergraphics algorithms, are prettier or handsomer than the individual faces that went into them. Average faces are a good start, but some faces are even more attractive than the average face. When boys reach puberty, testosterone builds up the bone in their jaws, brows, and nasal region. Girls faces grow more evenly. The difference in 3-D geometry allows us to tell a mans head from a womans even when they are both bald and shaved. If the geometry of a womans face is similar to a mans, she is homelier; if it is less similar, she is prettier. Beauty in a woman comes from a short, delicate, smoothly curved jawbone, a small chin, a small nose and upper jaw, and a smooth forehead without brow ridges. The "high cheekbones" of a beautiful woman are not bones at all but soft tissue, and contribute to beauty because the other parts of a beautiful face (the jaws, forehead, and nose) are small by comparison. Why are masculine-looking women less "attractive? If a womans face is masculinized, she probably has too much testosterone in her blood (a symptom of many diseases); if she has too much testosterone, she is likely to be infertile. Another explanation is that prettiness-detectors are really female-face detectors, designed to pick them out from every other object in the world and tuned to minimize the risk of a false alarm to a male face, which is the object most similar to a female face. The more unmanly the face, the louder the detector beeps. Similar engineering could explain why men with unfeminine faces are more handsome. A man with a large, angular jaw, a strong chin, and a prominent forehead and brow is undoubtedly an adult male with normal male hormones.

Teenage women have larger eyes, fuller and redder lips, smoother, moister, and tighter skin, and firmer breasts, all long recognized as ingredients of pulchritude.

Shape-analysis mechanisms not little men process information in the sketch by imposing reference frames, finding geons, and so on. A mental image is simply a pattern in the 272-D sketch that is loaded from long-term memory rather than from the eyes. A number of artificial intelligence programs for reasoning about space are designed in exactly this way. A depiction like the 2V2-D sketch contrasts starkly with a description in a language-like representation like a geon model, a semantic network, a sentence in English, or a proposition in mentalese. In the proposition A symmetrical triangle is above a circle, the words do not stand for points in the visual field, and they are not arranged so that nearby words represent nearby points. Words like symmetrical and above cant be pinned to any piece of the visual field; they denote complicated relationships among the filled-in pieces. The Minds Eye 287 One can even make an educated guess about the anatomy of mental imagery. The incarnation of a 2V2-D sketch in neurons is called a topographically organized cortical map: a patch of cortex in which each neuron responds to contours in one part of the visual field, and in which neighboring neurons respond to neighboring parts. The primate brain has at least fifteen of these maps, and in a very real sense they are pictures in the head. Neuroscientists can inject a monkey with a radioactive isotope of glucose while it stares at a bulls-eye. The glucose is taken up by the active neurons, and one can literally develop the monkeys brain as if it were a piece of film. It comes out of the darkroom with a distorted bulls-eye laid out over the visual cortex. Of course, nothing "looks at" the cortex from above; connectivity is all that matters, and the activity pattern is interpreted by networks of neurons plugged into each cortical map. Presumably space in the world is represented by space on the cortex because neurons are connected to their neighbors, and it is handy for nearby bits of the world to be analyzed together. For example, edges are not scattered across the visual field like rice but snake along a line, and most surfaces are not archipelagos but cohesive masses. In a cortical map, lines and surfaces can be handled by neurons that are highly interconnected. The brain is also ready for the second computational demand of an imagery system, information flowing down from memory instead of up from the eyes. The fiber pathways to the visual areas of the brain are two-way. They carry as much information down from the higher, conceptual levels as up from the lower, sensory levels. No one knows what these top-down connections are for, but they could be there to download memory images into visual maps. So mental images could be pictures in the head. Are they? There are two ways to find out. One is to see if thinking in images engages the visual parts of the brain. The other is to see if thinking in images works more like computing with graphics or more like computing with a database of propositions.

In 1993 an interviewer for the New York Times asked him about himself. He said that as a boy he loved war toys, especially his air rifle. As an adult, he relaxes by looking at battlefield photographs and had just ordered a thirty-volume Time-Life illustrated history of World War II. Like guys everywhere, he enjoys studying pictures of military hardware, like tanks, airplanes, warships, U-boats, submarines, and especially aircraft carriers. He has erotic dreams and finds himself attracted to beautiful women, often having to remind himself, "Im a monk!" None of this has stood in the way of his being one of historys great pacifists. And despite the oppression of his people, he remains an optimist and predicts that the twenty-first century will be more peaceful than the twentieth. Why? asked the interviewer. "Because I believe," he said, "that in the 20th century, humanity has learned something from many, many experi520 ences. Some positive, and many negative. What misery, what destruction! The greatest number of human beings were killed in the two world wars of this century. But human nature is such that when we face a tremendous critical situation, the human mind can wake up and find some other alternative. That is a human capacity." 8 THE MEANING OF LIFE an does not live by bread alone, nor by know-how, safety, children, or sex. People everywhere spend as much time as they can afford on activities that, in the struggle to survive and reproduce, seem pointless. In all cultures, people tell stories and recite poetry. They joke, laugh, and tease. They sing and dance. They decorate surfaces. They perform rituals. They wonder about the causes of fortune and misfortune, and hold beliefs about the supernatural that contradict everything else they know about the world. They concoct theories of the universe and their place within it. As if that werent enough of a puzzle, the more biologically frivolous and vain the activity, the more people exalt it. Art, literature, music, wit, religion, and philosophy are thought to be not just pleasurable but noble. They are the minds best work, what makes life worth living. Why do we pursue the trivial and futile and experience them as sublime? To many educated people the question seems horribly philistine, even immoral. But it is unavoidable for anyone interested in the biological makeup of Homo sapiens. Members of our species do mad deeds like taking vows of celibacy, living for their music, selling their blood to buy movie tickets, and going to graduate school. Why? How might we understand the psychology of the arts, humor, religion, and philosophy within the theme of this book, that the mind is a naturally selected neural computer? Every college has a faculty of arts, which usually dominates the institution in numbers and in the public eye. But the tens of thousands of scholars and millions of pages of scholarship have shed almost no light M 521 522 J on the question of why people pursue the arts at all. The function of the arts is almost defiantly obscure, and I think there are several reasons why. One is that the arts engage not only the psychology of aesthetics but the psychology of status. The very uselessness of art that makes it so incomprehensible to evolutionary biology makes it all too comprehensible to economics and social psychology.

A chronic poker face would suggest the worst: that the emotions a person declares in word and deed are shams. This theory is unproven, but no one can deny the phenomenon. People are vigilant for sham emotions and put the most faith in involuntary physiological giveaways. That underlies an irony of the telecommunications age. Long-distance phone service, electronic mail, faxes, and videoconferencing should have made the face-to-face business meeting obsolete. But meetings continue to be a major expense for corporations and support entire industries like hotels, airlines, and rental cars. Why do we insist on doing business in the flesh? Because we do not trust someone until we see what makes him sweat. Hotheads 417 FOOLS FOR LOVE Why does romantic love leave us bewitched, bothered, and bewildered? Could it be another paradoxical tactic like handcuffing oneself to railroad tracks? Quite possibly. Offering to spend your life and raise children with someone is the most important promise youll ever make, and a promise is most credible when the promiser cant back out. Here is how the economist Robert Frank has reverse-engineered mad love. Unsentimental social scientists and veterans of the singles scene agree that dating is a marketplace. People differ in their value as potential marriage partners. Almost everyone agrees that Mr. or Ms. Right should be good-looking, smart, kind, stable, funny, and rich. People shop for the most desirable person who will accept them, and that is why most marriages pair a bride and a groom of approximately equal desirability. Mate-shopping, however, is only part of the psychology of romance; it explains the statistics of mate choice, but not the final pick. Somewhere in this world of five billion people there lives the bestlooking, richest, smartest, funniest, kindest person who would settle for you. But your dreamboat is a needle in a haystack, and you may die single if you insist on waiting for him or her to show up. Staying single has costs, such as loneliness, childlessness, and playing the dating game with all its awkward drinks and dinners (and sometimes breakfasts). At some point it pays to set up house with the best person you have found so far. But that calculation leaves your partner vulnerable. The laws of probability say that someday you will meet a more desirable person, and if you are always going for the best you can get, on that day you will dump your partner. But your partner has invested money, time, childrearing, and forgone opportunities in the relationship. If your partner was the most desirable person in the world, he or she would have nothing to worry about, because you would never want to desert. But failing that, the partner would have been foolish to enter the relationship. Frank compares the marriage market with the rental market. Landlords desire the best of all tenants but settle for the best they can find, and renters want the best of all apartments but settle for the best they can find. Each invests in the apartment (the landlord may paint it the tenants favorite color; the tenant may install permanent decorations), so 418 each would be harmed if the other suddenly terminated the agreement. If the tenant could leave for a better flat, the landlord would have to bear the costs of an unrented unit and the search for a new tenant; he would have to charge a high rent to cover that risk, and would be loath', 'were in place for '),
(346, 170, 3, 'were most afraid of they cited lions, tigers, and snakes, unlikely hazards in the Windy City. Of course, fears do change with experience. For decades psychologists thought that animals learn new fears the way Pavlovs dogs learned to salivate to a bell. In a famous experiment, John B. Watson, the founder of behaviorism, came up behind an eleven-month-old boy playing with a tame white rat and suddenly clanged two steel bars together. After a few more clangs, the boy became afraid of the rat and other white furry things, including rabbits, dogs, a sealskin coat, and Santa Claus. The rat, too, can learn to associate danger with a previously neutral stimulus. A rat shocked in a white room will flee it for a black room every time it is dumped there, long after the shocker has been unplugged. But in fact creatures cannot be conditioned to fear just any old thing. Children are nervous about rats, and rats are nervous about bright rooms, before any conditioning begins, and they easily associate them with danger. Change the white rat to some arbitrary object, like opera glasses, and the child never learns to fear it. Shock the rat in a black room instead of a white one, and that nocturnal creature learns the association more slowly and unlearns it more quickly. The psychologist Mar388 tin Seligman suggests that fears can be easily conditioned only when the animal is evolutionarily prepared to make the association. Few, if any, human phobias are about neutral objects that were once paired with some trauma. People dread snakes without ever having seen one. After a frightening or painful event, people are more prudent around the cause, but they do not fear it; there are no phobias for electrical outlets, hammers, cars, or air-raid shelters. Television cliches notwithstanding, most survivors of a traumatic event do not get the screaming meemies every time they face a reminder of it. Vietnam veterans resent the stereotype in which they hit the dirt whenever someone drops a glass. A better way to understand the learning of fears is to think through the evolutionary demands. The world is a dangerous place, but our ancestors could not have spent their lives cowering in caves; there was food to gather and mates to win. They had to calibrate their fears of typical dangers against the actual dangers in the local environment (after all, not all spiders are poisonous) and against their own ability to neutralize the danger: their know-how, defensive technology, and safety in numbers. Marks and the psychiatrist Randolph Nesse argue that phobias are innate fears that have never been unlearned. Fears develop spontaneously in children. In their first year, babies fear strangers and separation, as well they should, for infanticide and predation are serious threats to the tiniest hunter-gatherers. (The film A Cry in the Dark shows how easily a predator can snatch an unattended baby. It is an excellent answer to every parents question of why the infant left alone in a dark bedroom is screaming bloody murder.) Between the ages of three and five, children become fearful of all the standard phobic objects spiders, the dark, deep water, and so on and then master them one by one. Most adult phobias are childhood fears that never went away. That is why it is city-dwellers who most fear snakes. As with the learning of safe foods, the best guides to the local dangers are the people who have survived them. Children fear what they see their parents fear, and often unlearn their fears when they see other children coping. Adults are just as', 'were most afraid of '),
(347, 171, 3, 'When animals size each other up they evolve ways to exaggerate their size: ruffs, balloons, manes, bristling, rearing, and bellowing, whose low pitch shows off the size of the resonating cavity in the animals body. If a fight is costly and a winner unpredictable, the faceoff may be decided by an arbitrary difference such as who arrived first, in the same way that human rivals may settle a dispute quickly by flipping a coin. If the animals are closely matched and the stakes are high enough (such as a harem), an all-out fight may ensue, sometimes to the death. If both creatures walk away, they may remember the outcome and thereafter the loser will defer to the winner. When many animals in a group spar or size one another up in a round-robin, the outcome is a pecking order, which correlates with the probability that each animal would win an all-out duel. When the probabilities change say, when a dominant animal gets old or injured, or an underling gains in strength or experience the underling may mount a challenge and the rankings may change. In chimpanzees, dominance depends not only on fighting prowess but on political acumen: a pair in cahoots may depose a stronger animal going it alone. Many group-living primates settle into two dominance hierarchies, one for each sex. The females compete for food; the males compete for females. Dominant males mate more often, both because they can shove other males out of the way and because the females prefer to mate with them, if for no other reason than that a highranking sex partner will tend to sire high-ranking sons, who will give the female more grandchildren than low-ranking sons. Humans dont have rigid pecking orders, but in all societies people recognize a kind of dominance hierarchy, particularly among men. Highranking men are deferred to, have a greater voice in group decisions, usually have a greater share of the groups resources, and always have more wives, more lovers, and more affairs with other mens wives. Men strive for rank, and achieve it in some ways that are familiar from zoology books and other ways that are uniquely human. Better fighters have higher rank, and men who look like better fighters have higher rank. Sheer height is surprisingly potent in a species that calls itself the rational animal. The word for "leader" in most foraging societies is "big man," and in fact the leaders usually are big men. In the United States, taller men are hired more, are promoted more, earn more ($600 per inch in annual salary), and are elected president more: the taller candidate won 496 twenty of the twenty-four elections between 1904 and 1996. A glance at the personal ads shows that women want taller men. As in other species whose males compete, the human male is bigger than the female, and has evolved ways of appearing bigger still, like a low voice and a beard (which makes the head look bigger and has evolved separately in lions and monkeys). Leonid Brezhnev claimed that he got to the top because of his eyebrows! Men everywhere exaggerate the size of their heads (with hats, helmets, headdresses, and crowns), their shoulders (with pads, boards, epaulettes, and feathers), and, in some societies, their penises (with impressive codpieces and sheaths, sometimes a yard long).

As Lamarck put it, "New needs which establish a necessity for some part really bring about the existence of that part as a result of efforts." If only it were so! As the saying goes, if wishes were horses, beggars would ride. There are no guardian angels seeing to it that every need is met. They are met only when mutations appear that are capable of building an organ that meets the need, when the organism finds itself in an environment in which meeting the need translates into more surviving babies, and in which that selection pressure persists over Revenge of the Nerds 207 thousands of generations. Otherwise, the need goes unmet. Swimmers do not grow webbed fingers; Eskimos do not grow fur.

Felt need is an alluring idea. Needs really do feel like they bring forth their own solutions. Youre hungry, you have hands, the foods in front of you, you eat with your hands; how else could it be? Ah, but youre the last one we should ask. Your brain was fashioned by natural selection so that it would find such problems obvious. Change the mind (to a robots, or to another animals, or to a neurological patients), or change the problem, and its no longer so obvious whats obvious. Rats cant learn to drop a piece of food for a larger reward. When chimpanzees try to imitate someone raking in an inaccessible snack, they dont notice that the rake has to be held business-end down, even if the role model makes a conspicuous show of aligning it properly. Lest you feel smug, the chapters to come will show how the design of our own minds gives rise to paradoxes, brain-teasers, myopias, illusions, irrationalities, and self-defeating strategies that prevent, rather than guarantee, the meeting of our everyday needs. But what about the Darwinian imperative to survive and reproduce? As far as day-to-day behavior is concerned, there is no such imperative. People watch pornography when they could be seeking a mate, forgo food to buy heroin, sell their blood to buy movie tickets (in India), postpone childbearing to climb the corporate ladder, and eat themselves into an early grave. Human vice is proof that biological adaptation is, speaking literally, a thing of the past. Our minds are adapted to the small foraging bands in which our family spent ninety-nine percent of its existence, not to the topsy-turvy contingencies we have created since the agricultural and industrial revolutions. Before there was photography, it was adaptive to receive visual images of attractive members of the opposite sex, because those images arose only from light reflecting off fertile bodies. Before opiates came in syringes, they were synthesized in the brain as natural analgesics. Before there were movies, it was adaptive to witness peoples emotional struggles, because the only struggles you could witness were among people you had to psych out every day. Before there was contraception, children were unpostponable, and status and wealth could be converted into more children and healthier ones.

But where does the topmost goal, the one that the rest of the program tries to attain, come from? For artificial intelligence systems, it comes from the programmer. The programmer designs it to diagnose soybean diseases or predict the next days Dow Jones Industrial Average. For organisms, it comes from natural selection. The brain strives to put its owner in circumstances like those that caused its ancestors to reproduce. (The brains goal is not reproduction itself; animals dont know the facts of life, and people who do know them are happy to subvert them, such as when they use contraception.) The goals installed in Homo sapiens, that problem-solving, social species, are not just the Four Fs. High on the list are understanding the environment and securing the cooperation of others. And here is the key to why we have emotions. An animal cannot pursue all its goals at once. If an animal is both hungry and thirsty, it should not stand halfway between a berry bush and a lake, as in the fable about the indecisive ass who starved between two haystacks. Nor should it nibble a berry, walk over and take a sip from the lake, walk back to nibble another berry, and so on. The animal must commit its body to one goal at a time, and the goals have to be matched with the best moments for achieving them. Ecclesiastes says that to every tiling there is a season, and a time to every purpose under heaven: a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to love, and a time to hate. Different goals are appropriate when a lion has you in its sights, when your child shows up in tears, or when a rival calls you an idiot in public. The emotions are mechanisms that set the brains highest-level goals. Once triggered by a propitious moment, an emotion triggers the cascade of subgoals and sub-subgoals that we call thinking and acting. Because the goals and means are woven into a multiply nested control structure of subgoals within subgoals within subgoals, no sharp line divides thinking from feeling, nor does thinking inevitably precede feeling or vice versa (notwithstanding the century of debate within psychology over 374 which comes first). For example, fear is triggered by a signal of impending harm like a predator, a clifftop, or a spoken threat. It lights up the short-term goal of fleeing, subduing, or deflecting the danger, and gives the goal high priority, which we experience as a sense of urgency It also lights up the longer-term goals of avoiding the hazard in the future and remembering how we got out of it this time, triggered by the state we experience as relief. Most artificial intelligence researchers believe that freely behaving robots (as opposed to the ones bolted to the side of an assembly line) will have to be programmed with something like emotions merely for them to know at every moment what to do next. (Whether the robots would be sentient of these emotions is another question, as we saw in Chapter 2.) Fear also presses a button that readies the body for action, the socalled fight-or-flight response.

Of course, we are not chauvinistic about trunks, so we can see that trunks evolved, but not because a rising tide made it inevitable. Thanks to fortuitous preconditions in the elephants ancestors (large size and certain kinds of nostrils and lips), certain selective forces (the problems posed by lifting and lowering a huge head), and luck, the trunk evolved as a workable solution for those organisms at that time. Other animals did not and will not evolve trunks because in their bodies and circumstances it is of no great help. Could it happen again, here or elsewhere?

We are chauvinistic about our brains, thinking them to be the: goal of Revenge of the Nerds 153 evolution. And that makes no sense, for reasons articulated over the years by Stephen Jay Gould. First, natural selection does nothing even close to striving for intelligence. The process is driven by differences in the survival and reproduction rates of replicating organisms in a particular environment. Over time the organisms acquire designs that adapt them for survival and reproduction in that environment, period; nothing pulls them in any direction other than success there and then. When an organism moves to a new environment, its lineage adapts accordingly, but the organisms who stayed behind in the original environment can prosper unchanged. Life is a densely branching bush, not a scale or a ladder, and living organisms are at the tips of the branches, not on lower rungs. Every organism alive today has had the same amount of time to evolve since the origin of life the amoeba, the platypus, the rhesus macaque, and, yes, Larry on the answering machine asking for another date. But, a SETI fan might ask, isnt it true that animals become more complex over time? And wouldnt intelligence be the culmination? In many lineages, of course, animals have become more complex. Life began simple, so the complexity of the most complex creature alive on earth at any time has to increase over the eons. But in many lineages they have not. The organisms reach an optimum and stay put, often for hundreds of millions of years. And those that do become more complex dont always become smarter. They become bigger, or faster, or more poisonous, or more fecund, or more sensitive to smells and sounds, or able to fly higher and farther, or better at building nests or dams whatever works for them. Evolution is about ends, not means; becoming smart is just one option. Still, isnt it inevitable that many organisms would take the route to intelligence? Often different lineages converge on a solution, like the forty different groups of animals that evolved complex designs for eyes. Presumably you cant be too rich, too thin, or too smart. Why wouldnt humanlike intelligence be a solution that many organisms, on this planet and elsewhere, might converge on? Evolution could indeed have converged on humanlike intelligence several times, and perhaps that point could be developed to justify SETI. But in calculating the odds, it is not enough to think about how great it is to be smart.

Thorstein Veblens and Quentin Bells analyses of taste and fashion, in which an elites conspicuous displays of consumption, leisure, and outrage are emulated by the rabble, sending the elite off in search of new inimitable displays, nicely explains the otherwise inexplicable oddities of the arts. The grand styles of one century become tacky in the next, as we see in words that are both period labels and terms of abuse {gothic, mannerist, baroque, rococo). The steadfast patrons of the arts are the aristocracy and those who want to join them. Most people would lose their taste for a musical recording if they learned it was being sold at supermarket checkout counters or on late-night television, and even the work of relatively prestigious artists, such as Pierre Auguste Renoir, draws derisive reviews when it is shown in a popular "blockbuster" museum show. The value of art is largely unrelated to aesthetics: a priceless masterpiece becomes worthless if it is found to be a forgery; soup cans and comic strips become high art when the art world says they are, and then command conspicuously wasteful prices. Modern and postmodern works are intended not to give pleasure but to confirm or confound the theories of a guild of critics and analysts, to epater la bourgeoisie, or to baffle the rubes in Peoria. The banality that the psychology of the arts is partly the psychology of status has been repeatedly pointed out, not just by cynics and barbarians but by erudite social commentators such as Quentin Bell and Tom Wolfe.

When the time to lay eggs came, she asked her husband to look for a safe place to lay her eggs, "My dear, please look for some good and safe place for me to lay eggs as it is almost time for me to lay the them." But the male Tittibha bird said, "Dearest, where in the world could be a better place than this seashore? Please lay your eggs here." She disagreed, "The waves of sea on full moon nights are so high that they can drag even an elephant into it. No, please find a place away from here." The male Tittibha bird laughed and insisted, "The Sea would not even dare to do any harm to my children! Do not fear unnecessarily and lay eggs here without any worries." All the time, the Sea had been hearing this, and thought, "From a small bird as he, such impudence is not expected. I\'ll certainly take away his eggs to see what he does after that and teach him a lesson." Within a few days, the female Tittibha bird laid her eggs in the seashore. Shortly afterward, when the birds went away in search of food, the Sea started making waves. The waves became higher and higher, till it swallowed the eggs into it. The birds returned later to find the nest empty. The female Tittibha bird started weeping bitterly, "See for yourself that the waves of the sea has swallowed our eggs. You are a fool not to listen to me when I asked you to find a safe place to lay eggs." The male Tittibha bird continued its stupidity, "Dear, don\'t you worry. I will prove to you how brilliant I am. I will dry the sea, and force it to return our eggs." The female Tittibha bird wondered, "How can you dry this enormous sea?" The male Tittibha bird explained, "Even small beings can overcome the strongest opponents if they are zealous. And so, I plan to dry up the whole sea by sucking its water with my beak." The wife argued, "How can you suck the sea dry, when rivers like the Ganges and Indus, and hundreds of other rivers flow into it. There is no good in this babbling". While the husband argued, "I\'ll work day and night to suck all the water from the sea with my beak, which is as solid as iron. Man can succeed only after putting efforts". The female Tittibha bird understood that she will not be able to convince him, "Dear, there is no point in arguing. If you want to conquer the sea, please call for your friends to help you". The husband agreed, "All right, I will do this with the help of my friends". Now, all the friends of the male Tittibha bird were called and when they all gathered together, the male Tittibha bird explained his problem with the sea, and how it had insulted him, and how he plans to dry the sea to seek revenge. All the birds, the swan, crane, peacock and other unanimously agreed that the task was impossible, "There is no good in this babbling. It is impossible for us to suck the sea to dry it up completely. Instead, let us visit our king, Garuda (Lord Vishnu\'s vehicle, and the king of birds according to Hindu mythology). When he comes to know that we have been harassed by the sea, he will get angry and seek revenge. Even if we merely pay him a visit to seek his advice, we shall feel relieved." As decided, they all went to their king, Garuda, and explained the reason of them being so sad, "O King, the sea has robbed the eggs of the good Tittibha birds even after the fact that you are our protector. If this is allowed to continue, our entire race shall perish." Garuda realized that the birds were in grave circumstances, and agreed to go and dry the entire sea. Just as he was leaving, a messenger arrived from Lord Vishnu who needed his assistance at once, for some divine task. Garuda explained to the messenger that he was unable to serve his master at this time, "I am such a common servant to the Lord for him to need me. The sea, which is the resting place of the Lord, has swallowed the eggs of the Tittibha birds. I refuse to serve him if he will not force the sea to return the eggs at once. This is my firm resolution. Please let him know of it." When Lord Vishnu came to know of Garuda\'s resolution from his messenger, he thought, "I can understand his behaviour and need to pacify him. He is the king and protector of all the birds. I must meet Garuda at once." As Lord Vishnu visited Garuda, he bowed in respect and explained, "O Master, the sea, which is your resting place has insulted me by swallowing the eggs of my humble servant, the good Tittibha birds. It is out of the respect that I have for you that I have not taken any step for revenge." Lord Vishnu considered his plea, "Come with me Garuda. You are right. The sea should not have done such a thing on purpose. Let us go and return the eggs to the Tittibha birds. After that we will leave, as I need your assistance." They all went to the seashore where Lord Vishnu reprimanded the sea. Taking a thunderbolt in his hand, he warned, "O Sea, you have been wicked. Return the eggs of the Tittibha birds at once or dare to face my anger." When the sea heard the warning from the Lord Vishnu himself, it was terrified. It apologised at once, and returned the eggs to the Tittibha birds. ', 'A pair of Tittibha '),

Due to lack of food, along with other animals, the dogs were starving. Some of them even died. Chitranga was not able to bear the hunger and realizing that the place did not offer conditions to live, he decided to leave for a foreign land in search of food and better conditions. After travelling a long distance, he came to a certain town. I saw a door open in one of the houses due to the negligence of a rich lady householder. He went into the house, and found abundant food. He had not eaten for a long time, and ate to his heart\'s content. Then he thought of leaving silently. No sooner had he come out of the house, he was spotted by other dogs of the neighbourhood. The realized he did not belong to their community and chased him. Since, he had his stomach full, he could not run fast, and they bit him all over with their sharp teeth. He somehow escaped, and thought, "It is better to live in peace in one\'s own country, be it affected by famine. I will rather return home." When he returned to his country, the starving dogs there were curious. His friends and relatives gathered around him to enquire about his findings, "Please tell us about the foreign country you visited. How is it like? How are the people? Is there plenty of food?" The dog said, "O friends and relatives! What can I say? In the foreign country, the women are careless. They leave doors and windows open. There is lots of food to eat. But, your own kith and kin will not show any sympathy. They will torment you to death." ', 'Chitranga was a dog, '),
(354, 178, 3, 'Two partridges (quail-like birds) lived in a certain tree in the jungle. While one of them lived on the branches, the other lived inside a hole at the foot of the tree. They became good friends, and they would spend long hours with each other telling each other stories and events of their lives. In this manner, the partridges spent their time in happiness. One day, one of them went away with some more partidges in search of food. As was usual, when he did not return back even at sunset, the other partridge started worrying. He thought, "He has not done this ever. Why has the partridge not returned home today? Has been trapped by some hunter? Or maybe even killed? I cannot live without him. I am certain there is some reason why he has not returned even at nightfall." He did not return even the next day, or the day after. For several days, the partridge kept worrying, and then gave up hope of his friend\'s return. "And so, I spent several days worrying. On nightfall, a hare came to the tree and observing an empty hole at the foot of the tree, took shelter inside. Since, the partridge had given up hope, he did not object to the hole being occupied by the hare. After a few days the partridge returned. He had gone to a place where there was plenty of food to eat. He had grown fat, but remembering his dear friend, he thought of returning. On his return, when he found that a hare had taken over his house, he objected strongly, "Hare! This hole is my home, and you have taken over during my absence. This is very unfair of you. I demand you to leave immediately". The hare disagreed, "This place is mine now. I am not leaving. I found this hole empty, and therefore made it my home". Thus, they began to quarrel. The partridge understood there was no point in quarrelling with the hare, and said, "Hare! You seem to lack the basic ethics. Let us approach someone holy and knowledgeable. Let someone well-versed in holy books decide who is right, and thus, who shall have the right to occupy the hole." The hare agreed, and as suggested they went to look for a holy man to settle their dispute. Meanwhile, a wild tomcat became aware that they wanted to settle their dispute through a holy man. He quickly posed as a learned animal. He held a blade of holy Kusha grass in his paw and stood on the bank of a river, where he will be quickly spotted. Standing on his hind legs, with his eyes closed, he started chanting. When the partridge and the hare came across him, the hare said, "He looks holy, and a learned person. Let us go and seek his advice." The partridge agreed but said, "Yes, let us seek his opinion. But he is a wild cat by birth, and a natural enemy for both of us. We should be careful, and speak only from a distance." As decided, they came to the wild tomcat, but stood at a distance, "Holy person! We have a dispute amongst us. Will you please settle our dispute and advice us who is right in accordance to Holy Scriptures. If you decide that one of us has sinned, you may as well eat him!" The tomcat replied, "O my friends, I have denounced the violent life as it leads to hell. Non-violence is the very essence of true religion. I shall not harm any of you. However, I will hear both of you and settle your dispute with the knowledge I have gained." Both the partridge and the hare were impressed. The wild tomcat continued, "But I am old, and cannot hear you from that distance. Fear not! I do not even harm a lice, bug or a mosquito. Come close, and explain the reason of your dispute. I shall make the most just settlement." With all these sayings, he won the confidence of both of them. Both the partridge and the hare came near him and sat close to him to explain the reason of their dispute. This was the very opportunity that the tomcat was looking for. As soon as they sat beside him, he jumped and seized one of them in his teeth and the other with his claws. He killed both of them and made a meal out of them.

(355, 179, 3, 'There was a temple of Lord Shiva (God of destruction) near a southern city called Mahilaropyam. A holy sage used to live and look after the temple. He would visit the city everyday for alms, and return in the evening for meal. He collected more than he required for himself, and would keep the excess in a bowl, and distribute it among poor workers, who cleaned and decorated the temple in return. A mouse, who lived in a hole in the hermitage would creep in everyday and steal some of the food from the bowl. When the hermit realized that a mouse has been stealing the food. He tried all ways to stop it. He hung the bowl as high as he could, and even tried to beat the mouse with a stick, but the mouse would find some way to reach the bowl and steal some food. One day, a mendicant came to visit the temple, and the sage. But the hermit was absent-minded and looked for an opportunity to hit the mouse with his stick, lest it come again. This made the mendicant angry, "I will not visit your hermitage again, for you are giving only vague and abstract replies to by queries. You seem to be pre-occupied with something more important than talking to me!" The hermit humbly explained his troubles, and how the mouse keeps stealing from him, somehow or the other, "This mouse would even put a cat or a monkey to shame, when it comes to jumping and reaching my bowl! I have tried everything. I keep hitting my bowl with my stick, even while talking to you, to save the food I keep for my workers being stolen from the mouse." The mendicant understood the hermit\'s troubles, and advised, "A mouse that jumps more than it should be, a mouse that is faster than the others, must have some reason for it. I am sure it must have accumulated a lot of food in his hole. This is the reason that the mouse feels exalted, and has the energy to jump so high. The mouse knows he has nothing to lose, and thus nothing to fear." And thus, the holy man and the mendicant concluded that if they can track the mouse to its hole, they will be able to reach a store of food. They decided to follow the tracks of the mouse the very next morning. They followed the mouse\'s tracks and arrived at the entrance of the hole. At once, they started digging with a pickaxe and uncovered a huge collection of food stored by the mouse, which it guarded. They collected the food and stored it safely in the temple. On the other hand, the mouse was very depressed on realizing the entire store of food that it had accumulated for so long had been lost. It felt deeply dejected, and lost all its confidence. The mouse had no food, and decided to jump for the bowl at nightfall. But when it tried to reach the bowl, it realized that it had neither the strength, nor the confidence to reach the bowl. During this time, the sage charged it with a stick. It was so depressed, that it was not able to react quickly, and was hit. It was not a deadly blow, but it was hurt. Somehow, it managed to escape and left the temple at once. It decided not to return to the temple again. ', 'There was a temple '),

The merchant,s son replied, "I feel sorry for you. When I was taking my bath, your boy was standing on the bank. Just then, a flamingo flying above swept down and carried your boy off in its claws.

All three of them would meet on the banks of the lake every day, and exchanged stories, before returning at sunset. They enjoyed each other,s company. One year, there was no rain and lake started to dry. The swans got worried about the declining water level of the lake, and said to the turtle, "You will not be able to survive in this lake. All the water in the lake will soon dry up". The turtle was aware of the problem, "It is indeed difficult to live here anymore. Dear friends, please look for an alternate lake which is full of water. Then, find a strong stick from somewhere." The turtle continued, "Once you find another lake, you can carry me to the lake with a stick. I can hold the stick tightly with my mouth, while both of you can hold the stick at either ends and fly". As planned, the swans flew to distant places and after some time found a lake which had plenty of water in it. They returned to carry the turtle. They prepared to hold the stick from both the ends, and suggested the turtle, "Dear friend, everything seems fine. But make sure to keep your mouth tightly shut all the time. You must not speak, or you will fall off." Finally, they started flying. After some time, they had flown some distance when the turtle saw a town below. The people of the town were staring at the sight of two swans carrying a turtle in the sky. "Look at that! This is a rare sight that two birds are carrying a turtle with the help of a stick", they shouted in admiration. On hearing all the commotion, the turtle opened her mouth, "What is all the commotion about?", she asked. Needless to say, she went down the moment she opened her mouth, and the swans could do nothing to stop her from falling down to the earth. As she fell down, the people of the town captured her to make a feast out of her. ', 'There lived a turtle '),
(358, 182, 3, 'Young Peter Black was a good man, but everyone said he had one big fault. He loved to tell wild stories. Peter was the sexton at the Church of St. Thomas the Believer, there in the little town of Tabby-on-Thames. He stayed in the cottage behind the church, right next to Father Allen’s house. Many were the jobs he’d held before that, but with his wild stories, he’d managed to lose every one. Father Allen had warned him. "Peter, this is the last job you’re likely to get in this town. If you want to keep it, your wild stories must stop! "One night Peter couldn’t sleep. He tossed and he turned and at last got up to make himself some tea. But when he glanced out his window, he saw the windows of the church ablaze with light. "What in the world ? muttered Peter. "There shouldn’t be anyone there, this time of night. And how’d they get in, anyway?" Peter pulled on a coat, crossed the yard, and quietly unlocked the back door. As he crept through the vestry, he heard a sound from the church. Meow, meow "Sounds like a cat," murmured Peter. "But I never knew a cat to light a candle. "He peered around the curtain hung at the church entrance, and what he saw made him gasp.There was not one cat,but hundreds of cats, of every size and coloring. They filled the pews, and all of them sat upright just like people. On the steps to the altar, a big black cat-the biggest cat Peter had ever seen-was kneeling with his head bowed.Standing above him with paws upraised was a black cat in bishop’s robes, intoning, "Meow, meow" An altar kitten approached with a velvet pillow on which lay a small goldencrown. The bishop lifted the crown and solemnly placed it on the kneeling cat’s head. The church exploded with cries of Meow, meow! Peter didn’t wait to see more. He raced through the vestry and back to his cottage, where he jumped into bed and stayed trembling under the covers till morning. Bright and early, Peter was over to see Father Allen. The priest was reading in the conservatory, his black cat Tom curled up on his lap. "Good morning, Peter," said the priest. "What brings you here so early?" "Father Allen, I came to tell you about something terribly weird in the church last night. I saw these lights and I went over to check, and I heard a meow-" "Meow," said the priest’s cat, Tom. "Yes, just like that," said Peter. "And when I looked, there were hundreds of cats in the church. And there was this one big black cat, and he was kneeling in front, and their bishop was crowning him-" Father Allen was looking at him sternly. "Peter, do you remember what I told you about wild stories?" "Of course I do, Father." "Then let’s have no more of this, all right?" "But, Father-" "Listen, Peter, I have an errand for you. Will you walk over to Brambleton today and deliver a message to Father Rowan?" Peter would and Peter did. But he didn’t get to it till late afternoon, and by the time he started home, it was already dusk. He decided to take a shortcut cross-country. He was halfway through a meadow and up to a stand of trees when he heard a commotion. From beyond the meadow came the barking of a dog and a chorus of Meow, meow. "Is it those cats again?" said Peter in alarm, ducking behind a tree. An Irish setter raced into the meadow, barking for all it was worth. Right behind were a dozen cats with bows and arrows, riding-yes riding-on the backs of bridled foxes. The big black cat at their head was wearing a golden crown. At first Peter thought the setter was leading the cats on the trail of their quarry. Then he realized, No, they’re hunting the dog! As the cat with the crown rode by a large rock, his fox tripped and stumbled and the cat went flying. He struck his head on the rock and lay still. The other cats gave up the chase and crowded anxiously around him. Then with loud, mournful cries of Meow, meow, they laid him over the back of his fox and returned the way they had come. Peter stood shaking till they were out of sight, then nipped off home as fast as his wobbly legs would bear him. He found Father Allen at supper, with his cat, Tom, nibbling from a dish by the table. "Father, it’s about those cats. I was crossing a meadow, and I heard a dog barking and all these cats crying meow-""Meow," said Tom."Yes, just like that," said Peter. "And then the cats came riding into the meadow on foxes, all of them chasing this dog, but then the cat with the crown fell off and hit his head and .. and ... and .. Father, why’s Tom staring at me like that?" Father Allen put down his fork. "Peter, I’ve warned you often enough about your wild stories. Now, if you come to me talking like this again, I’m going to have to let you go. Do you understand?" "But, Father, it’s no story. I swear it!" "That’s enough, Peter! Now, I’m sorry to ask you so late, but I have another chore for you. Mrs. Pennyweather has passed on suddenly, and tomorrow’s the funeral. I need you to dig her grave-tonight. "So it was that Peter was digging in the graveyard by the light of the full moon. It was hard work, and he had to keep resting, and it wasn’t till right around midnight that he finished. Just as he was about to climb out, he heard a distant Meow, then again, Meow, and again, Meow. "It’s the cats!" declared Peter. He scrunched down in the grave, then carefully peered over the edge. Coming across the graveyard was the black bishop cat, and behind him were six more black cats, carrying on their shoulders a small coffin. The box was covered with a pall of black velvet, and sitting on top was the golden crown that Peter had seen twice before. The cats walked slowly and solemnly, and at every third step cried, Meow. Their path went right by the grave where Peter hid, and when they were but a few feet away, the bishop held up a paw for a halt.Then he turned and stared straight at Peter and spoke. "Tell Tom Tildrum. . . that Tim Toldrum’s . . . dead." Then he lowered his paw, and the cats walked on, and at every third step cried, Meow. Well, Peter scrambled out of that grave and bolted for Father Allen’s.He pounded on the door, shouting, "Father! Father! Let me in! "At last the door opened and Father Allen stood there sleepily in his nightshirt. "Peter, what’s going on? "Let me in, Father, please, and I’ll tell you." Father Allen led him into the library, where Tom yawned and stretched on his cat bed. The priest lit a lamp. "Now, what’s this all about, Peter?" "Father, you’ve got to believe me. I was out digging Mrs. Pennyweather’s grave when I heard a meow-" "Meow," said Tom. "Yes, just like that," said Peter. "And I looked and saw seven black cats, and one was the bishop, and the others were carrying a coffin with a crown, and they came right up next to me, and the bishop stopped them and stared at me just like Tom there and . . . and . . . and . . . Father, why’s Tom staring at me like that?" "Peter-" began the priest. "But, Father, I tell you, he spoke to me! And he gave me a message. I’m to tell Tom Tildrum that Tim Toldrum’s dead. But how can I tell Tom Tildrum that Tim Toldrum’s dead when I don’t know who Tom Tildrum is?" "Peter, this is the last straw. I’ve warned you again and again-" "Father! Look at Tom! Look at Tom!" Tom was swaying, and Tom was swelling, and Tom was standing on his two hind legs, and then Tom spoke. "What? Tim Toldrum dead? Then I’m the King o’ the Cats!" Tom leaped toward the fireplace, and with a single Meow, he bounded up the chimney and was gone. Never to be seen again. Of course, after that, there was no more talk of Peter losing his job. But as for Father Allen- Well, Father Allen was a good man, but everyone said he had one big fault. He loved to tell wild stories-about Tom, the King o’ the Cats. Meow. ', 'Young Peter Black was '),

Once, due to heavy rains the river was flooded. One night, the whole village was submerged in neck deep water. The crop, houses and factories in the village were destroyed and hundreds of people and cattle perished in the flood. The merchant had to suffer heavy losses in his business. He decided to shift to some other town to try his luck. His plan was to earn a lot of money and then come back to his native village to start his business again. Jveernadhana had a heavy iron balance lying with him. It belonged to his ancestors. It was not possible for him to carry such a heavy thing along with him. So, before starting on his journey, he decided to keep this ancestral item with his friend Janak. He met Janak and requested him, "My friend, as you know, I\'m leaving for some distant place to earn money, so that I could start my business once again when I come back. I have an old iron balance with me. Will you please keep it safe with you till I return?" Janak readily agreed to his friend\'s request and said, "Don\'t worry, I\'ll keep it safe for you. You can take it back after you return home." Jveernadhana thanked Janak for his helping attitude. He kept the iron balance with Janak and left for some other distant town. A few years passed by. By this time, Jveernadhana had done good business and had earned a lot of money. He returned to his native village, and went to his friend Janak\'s house to meet him. Janak showed his happiness in meeting Jveernadhana. Both the friends talked together for hours. When it was time to leave, Jveernadhana asked his friend to return his iron balance. At this, Janak looked sad and said, "Friend, I am sorry to say that I don\'t have your balance with me anymore. There are a lot of mice in my house. They ate up your balance." Jveernadhana was surprised to hear Janak\'s explanation. \'How can mice eat iron,\' he thought to himself, but apparently he said something different, "Don\'t feel sorry, Janak. The mice have always proved a menace to everyone. Let us forget about it." "Yes," Janak said. "This is the only way out." He was happy that Jveernadhana believed his words. In fact he had expected a lot of heated arguments in this respect. While taking leave from his friend, Jveernadhana said to Janak,"I\'m going to temple to make an offering of laddoos. Could you please send your son with me. I would like to send some laddoos for you also. He would also look after my shoes outside the temple while I offer prayers inside." Janak asked his son to go along with Jveernadhana. Then, Jveernadhana, instead, of taking Janak\'s son to temple, took him to a nearby hill and tied him with a big rock and came back home. When Janak didn\'t see his son return, he asked Jveernadhana where his son was? "I\'m sorry," said Jveernadhana. "While your son was looking after my shoes outside the temple, a big vulture swooped down upon him and carried himaway." "What nonsense!" shouted Janak. "How can a vulture carry off a young boy?" But Jveernadhana repeatedly claimed that a vulture carried away Janak\'s son. The argument reached such a point that they began quarrelling with each other, using dirty words. Ultimately the matter had to be taken to the court. The Judge listened to both the parties and ordered Jveernadhana to bring Janak\'s son to the court, otherwise, he would be sent to jail. "My Lord", said Jveernadhana, "How can I, when a vulture has already carried away the boy." "Shut up!" the judge reprimanded Jveernadhana. "How can a bird carry away a young boy in his talons?" "It can, my lord," said Jveernadhana. "If mice can eat my iron balance, why can\'t a bird carry away a grown up boy." Then he narrated the whole story to the judge. The judge then asked Janak to tell the truth. He warned him that if he didn\'t tell the truth he would be sent to prison. At last, Janak admitted his guilt. The judge ordered him to return the iron balance to Jveernadhana. He asked Jveernadhana to return the boy to Janak. ', 'Once upon a time, '),

Their leader was a magnificent and rare white elephant who was an extremely kind-hearten soul. He greatly loved his mother who had grown blind and feeble and could not look out for herself. Each day this white elephant would go deep into the forest in search of food. He would look for the best of wild fruit to send to his mother. But alas, his mother never received any. This was because his messengers would always eat them up themselves. Each night, when he returned home he would be surprised to hear that his mother had been starving all day.

He had come to the area to visit relatives and could not find his way out. On seeing this big white elephant he was even more terrified and ran as fast as he could. The elephant followed him and told him not to be afraid, as all he wanted to do was to help him. He asked the forester why he was crying so bitterly. The forester replied that he was crying because he had been roaming the forest for the past seven days and could not find his way out. The elephant told him not to worry as he knew every inch of this forest and could take him to safety. He then lifted him on to his back and carried him to the edge of the forest from where the forester went on his merry way back to Benaras. On reaching the city, he heard that King Brahmadutta’s personal elephant had just died and the King was looking for a new elephant. His heralds were roaming the city, announcing that any man who had seen or heard of an elephant fit for a King should come forward with the information. The forester was very excited and immediately went up to the King and told him about the white elephant that he had seen on Mount Candorana. He told him that he had marked the way and would require the help of the elephant trainers in order to catch this fantastic elephant. The King was quite pleased with the information and immediately dispatched a number of soldiers and elephant trainers along with the forester. After travelling for many days, the group reached the lake besides which the elephants resided. They slowly moved down to the edge of the lake and hid behind the bushes. The white elephant was collecting lotus shoots for his mother’s meal and could sense the presence of humans. When he looked up, he spotted the forester and realized that it was he who had led the King’s men to him. He was very upset at the ingratitude but decided that if he put up a struggle many of the men would be killed. And he was just too kind to hurt anyone. So he decided to go along with them to Benaras and then request the benevolent King to be set free. That night when the white elephant did not return home, his mother was very worried. She had heard all the commotion outside and had guessed that the King’s men had taken away her son. She was scared that the King would ride him in to battle and her son would definitely be killed. She was also worried that there would be no one to look after her or even feed her, as she could not see. She just lay down and cried bitterly. Meanwhile her son was led in to the beautiful city of Benaras where he was given a grand reception. The whole city was decorated and his own stable was gaily painted and covered with garlands of fragrant flowers. The trainers laid out a feast for their new state elephant who refused to touch a morsel. He did not respond to any kind of stimuli, be it the fragrant flowers or the beautiful and comfortable stable. He just sat there looking completely despondent. The worried trainers went straight to report the situation to their King, as they were scared that the elephant would just waste away without any food or water. The King was extremely concerned when he heard what they had to say and went to the stable himself. ', 'Once upon a time, '),
(363, 187, 3, 'Once upon a time there were two friends in a small village named Dharmabuddhi (Virtuous-Mind or Right-Mind) and Papabuddhi (Wicked-Mind or Wrong-Mind). One day, the wicked of the two, Papabuddhi, thought to himself that he was poor and lacked the knowledge to earn for himself. He thought of taking Dharmabuddhi to another kingdom and use his skills to make money. He thought, "If I can deprive him of all the earnings, I can have all the money for myself and live happily" Right-Mind And Wrong-Mind - Panchatantra Story PictureAfter some time, he met Dharmabuddhi, "My friend, we need to earn money to provide for ourselves when we grow old. Let us travel to some other kingdom to earn money. Besides, unless we travel to far-off kingdoms, we will not have any stories to tell our grand children!" Dharmabuddhi agreed to his plan, and took the blessings of his parents and teachers to travel to a distant kingdom. On an auspicious day, they began their journey. The two of them made a lot of money due to Dharmabuddhi\'s skills and knowledge. After some time, pleased with their earnings, they planned to return home. Right-Mind And Wrong-Mind - Panchatantra Story PictureOn their way to their home, as they approached their village, Papabuddhi said to Dharmabuddhi, "Friend, It will be improper for us to carry so much money home as all our friends and relatives will start requesting us money. Besides, there is danger of theft." He said, "Let us bury the money in the jungle, where nobody will find it, after taking only a nominal amount for our needs. Whenever we need some money, we can come back together and dig it out". Without doubting his intentions, Dharmabuddhi agreed. They buried most of the money beneath a tree and returned home with only a handful of money. Few days later, Papabuddhi, wrong-minded as he was, went to the jungle alone in the dead of the night. He uncovered all the money they had buried together, took out all the money, and closed the pit as it was before. He returned back home with all the money, and hid it. After a few days, pretending that nothing has happened, he went to meet Dharmabuddhi, "Friend, I have a large family and the money I had come with - have been spent already. Let us go together to the place we have buried our money to fetch some more." Right-Mind And Wrong-Mind - Panchatantra Story PictureDharmabuddhi agreed and together they went to the place they had buried their money, and dug up the pit. But they found the money was not there. Papabuddhi started beating his head, and blamed Dharmabuddhi, "It is you no doubt. Nobody else knew where we have buried the money. You have stolen all the money for yourself. If you do not give me my half of the money, I shall go and complain to the village elders for justice." Taken aback, Dharmabuddhi protested, "I have committed no such theft. Don\'t put the blame on me, as I am a virtuous man". And so, they started quarrelling, and visited the village elders for justice. The elders asked them to pledge before the Fire-God to find the truth. Papabuddhi suggested, "Before pledging before the Fire-God, we can request the spirit of the tree to stand witness. It was in front of a big tree that we had buried all the money; and it may be able to reveal to us who the thief is". The judges agreed, "We shall go the jungle together, and request the spirit of the tree to reveal the truth to us. If that fails, we will take pledge before the Fire-God." Papabuddhi immediately went home to his father, "I have stolen a huge amount of money from Dharmabuddhi, and we have taken the matter to the village elders. Your co-operation will save me and put the blame on Dharmabuddhi. Otherwise, I shall not only lose the money but face the risk of losing my life for stealing". His father said, "My son, tell me how I can help you so you don\'t have to part from the money". Papabuddhi explained, "There is a huge hollow inside the big tree where we had buried the money. You have to get inside the hollow before morning. When all of us go to the jungle as request the spirit of the tree to reveal the truth, you have to shout from inside that Dharmabuddhi is the real thief. I can handle the rest." Right-Mind And Wrong-Mind - Panchatantra Story PictureAs agreed, his father went to the jungle and hid himself in the hollow of the tree early next morning. After some time, accompanied by the elders of the village, both Dharmabuddhi and Papabuddhi led themselves to the huge tree where they had buried their money. Papabuddhi asked in a loud voice, "O spirit of the tree. Please tell us who the thief is, as we have a confrontation and the village elders have come to seek the truth." Immediately, Papabuddhi\'s father replied from inside the hollow of the tree, "Listen all who seek the truth. Dharmabuddhi is the thief, who has stolen all the money." Right-Mind And Wrong-Mind - Panchatantra Story PictureThe village elders were wonderstruck. They could not deny that the spirit of the tree had indeed revealed the truth. They immediately started discussing amongst themselves how they should punish for Dharmabuddhi\'s guilt. Meanwhile, when Dharmabuddhi heard the spirit of tree speak such, he became sure that there must be something wrong. The spirit of the tree, if it was so, is telling untruth. That is not possible. Having seen the hollow of the tree, he put a heap of dried leaves and grass in front of the hollow of the tree and set fire to it. When the fire started flaring up, Papabuddhi\'s father could not bear the heat and the smoke inside the hollow any longer. He came out, with burns in his body, crying for pity. Right-Mind And Wrong-Mind - Panchatantra Story PictureThe village elders were surprised to find him coming outside from the hollow of the tree, "What were you doing here? And what has happened to you?" He at once confessed his part, and explained the village elders what his son had done.

One day, he climbed up the water-wheel and left his kingdom. He sought revenge on his relatives, due to whose constant torment; he had to leave his kingdom. Just then, he saw a cobra entering his cobra. He thought of a plan of having his relatives eaten up by the cobra. He went to the entrance of the hole, and said, "My friend, I have come to make friends to you. I am the king of frogs!" On hearing this, the cobra realized that it was not the voice of his kith or kin, but his natural enemy. He decided not to leave his hole and come out, for he suspected some foul reason. He suspected someone might be trying to catch him through mantra (magic spell), or maybe flute, or even herbs. He answered cautiously, "Who are you? Why do you talk this nonsense about friendship? Can timber and fire ever be friends? You are my natural enemy!" The king of frogs replied, "Indeed, your words are true. But I seek revenge on my relatives who have tormented me for years. I ask your help. I can lead you to the well, that is my forsaken kingdom, and you can eat as many frogs as you want" The cobra enquired, "A well is built by layers of stone. I have no legs. How can I possibly get into the well? And even if I manage to do so, where will I be able to sit and eat the frogs? Go away!" The king of frogs assured, "There is a nice comfortable hols at the edge of the water, where you can sit and eat. I will lead you to the inside of the well, and to the comfortable hole. But you will have to promise me that you will eat only my annoying relatives and not my friends." The cobra thought of his old age, and this offer was not good to be turned down. The greedy cobra agreed to the friendship and followed the frog. He went into the hole as promised. Once there, he would eat one frog whenever he would feel hungry. As days went by, the number of frogs went down and finally all annoying frogs were exhausted.

He assured the cobra that if he let him leave the well, he will bring frogs from other wells, so that the cobra would be able to satisfy his hunger. The cobra got greedy, and let the king of frogs go. But even after his anxious wait for several days, the king of frogs did not return. After a long time of waiting, the cobra requested a female lizard that lived in the walls of the well, to request the king of frogs to return, as he could not bear the separation of his dear friend. The lizard conveyed the message to the king of frogs, who replied, "Madam, please convey to him that I will never return to the well again.

They decided to travel, in order to earn money using their learnings. But the fourth friend was not learned, so they thought of leaving him behind. They agreed, "What good is common-sense? His talents would not help in earning money, let only three of us travel."

But his preference was ignored by the other three Brahmins, and they started holy rituals. One of the Brahmins collected the bones of the lion and using his scholarship, created a skeleton of the lion. Another Brahmin used his scholarship to cover the skeleton with flesh and skin. As the lifeless lion stood in front of them, the third Brahmin initiated the rituals to put life into the lion.

I am sure the fruit is sent from heavens only for me". On saying so, it started eating the fruit with utmost pleasure. While eating, it kept on praising how it was the most delicious fruit he had ever eaten.

It makes no difference on who eats the fruit. Moreover, since I am the one who found this fruit in the first place, I have the right to eat it myself."

(369, 193, 3, 'Chandra was a king, whose sons kept a group of monkeys as pets. These monkeys were treated as royal pets, and were provided with the choicest of foods and the best of care. As they did not have much to do, they had become fat. The chief of these monkeys was very wise. The followed great philosophers and was learned in many sciences. He always tried to teach the other monkeys, but they had become too absorbed in their lavish lives to follow much of his teachings. On the other hand, the princes also had two strong rams (billy goats), which used to draw the carriage used by the young princes. One of the rams was a glutton, and would creep into the kitchen whenever he could and eat whatever he could get there. This made the cooks very angry, and they would keep a watch. The cooks would throw anything they could lay their hand on, to hit the ram, when he would be near the kitchen. Noticing the cooks trying to hit him with sticks, earthen pots, copper pans and anything they found handy, the chief of the monkeys thought, "This behaviour could lead to accidents, and this entire city may perish. What if they threw something with fire?" The chief of monkeys summoned the other monkey and said, "The behaviour of the cooks towards the ram can lead to some mishap any day, and we may well be on the losing side, if that is to happen. Let us get away from here, before some accident is to happen." But, the other monkeys were enjoying their lavish treatment, and did not go back to the jungle. They refused to heed the chief\'s warnings, and decided to stay. They assumed that the chief was getting old, and having all types of weird thoughts. Thus, the chief of monkeys decided to leave alone. He said, "You are more fools than crazy not to foresee the danger. I shall leave here, as I value life more than the abundant foods served here!" After the chief of monkey had departed to the jungle alone, one day, the ram entered the kitchen and ate some food that was being organized to be served to the king. One of the cooks got very angry, and unable to get anything else handy, threw a half-burnt log from the oven. The log hit the ram. As the ram\'s body was covered with wool, it instantly caught fire. In the pain of fire on him, the ram ran to the stable. The dry grass for the horses caught fire, and in a moment the whole stable was engulfed in fire. There was a pandemonium, and by the time, the fire was extinguished by the palace workers, the horses suffered grave burnings. When the news reached the king, he was very depressed that such a thing had happened to his favourite horses, and summoned veterinary surgeons to prescribe him remedy. After referring many scriptures, the veterinary surgeons advised, "O King, the wounds caused by fire will recover fast, if they are applied with monkey\'s fat." Thus, the king ordered all the pet monkeys be caught, and killed immediately. The fat from their bodies were then used to treat the horse\'s wounds. When this news reached the chief of the monkeys, he was very sad. He thought, "The monkeys were foolish not to heed the warnings, but the king is wicked for doing this to his pets. I will make him pay for his actions!" He had not eaten food, or drunk water for several days as he was heart-broken. Absent-mindedly, he came to a lake full of beautiful lotus. He was thirsty, and decided to drink some water. As he came near the lake, he noticed that there were many footprints of both men and animals, that led to the lake, but not a single footprint led away from the lake. He became aware, and concluded there must be something wrong in this beautifully decorated lake. He fetched some hollow stems of lotus plant nearby, and using them as a pipe, drank water from a distance. As he was doing so, a monster emerged from the lake. He had a necklace of jewels around his neck. He said, "I am a monster who lives in this lake. Whoever enters this lake to bath or drink water, ends up in my tummy. For so many years, I have not seen anybody as wise as you! You drink water from the lake, but maintain a distance where I cannot touch you. I am so pleased with you, that I shall grant any wish you may want!" The chief of monkey immediately remembered that he had a revenge to take, and said, "Tell me, how many can you eat? I have a certain king as my enemy. If you give me your necklace, I shall use it to persuade the king and his men to enter the lake." The monster replied, "If they enter the lake, I can eat thousands of them. Go ahead and bring as many as you can!" The chief of monkey wore the necklace in his neck and jumped from tree to tree to reach the palace as early as possible. He went straight into the king\'s court. When the king and everybody else saw the chief of monkeys wearing a beautiful necklace of jewels, they became curious. They asked the chief of monkeys all sort of questions. The chief of monkey said to the king, "O king, while wandering in the jungle, I have come across a large treasure that Kuber (God of treasures) has hidden. It is secretly hidden inside a lake. Anyone, who takes a bath in the lake on a Sunday, can have as much treasure as he can carry. This necklace is nothing compared to the other treasures there! The diamonds in the lake would even put the sun to shame!" When the king heard this, he said, "Hey Monkey Chief, if this lake really exists, please take lead us to it. I will come to see it myself, and even bring everybody in the palace along with me." It was decided, and in the early morning of the very next Sunday, the king and the chief of the monkeys set to travel inside the jungle. They were followed by the princes, queens, ministers, household workers and everybody else in the palace. When they reached the place, everybody was awe-struck to see the lake full of lotus. The chief of monkeys said, "Everybody should enter the lake at the same time, or only the first few will received the blessings. As for you, my king, you should wait. I will show you a special place to enter the lake after they have gone into the lake." The greedy king, and everybody else followed his instructions and got into the lake. One by one, they started to disappear. The king kept anxiously waiting for them to return with treasures. When his people and relatives did not come out of the lake after a long time, the king asked, "O Monkey Chief, why do they not come out? Why is it that they take so long time?" The chief of the monkeys jumped to the top of a tree and replied, "O wicked king, a monster lives in this very lake that has eaten all your court members, and relatives. I have now killed all your family, as you have killed mine. The scriptures say, it is not a sin to return evil for evil deeds." He continued, "I have saved you, for you were once my master! You may return to your palace, empty-handed and alone." Thus, the king returned to his palace after losing all his relatives and household members, while the chief of monkeys had his revenge.

When he got up, he saw blood was oozing out of his forehead. There was a deep cut due to a broken piece of pot. Poor that he was, he did not go apply any medicine on his wound, which is the reason that the wound did not heal for a long time. After a long time, the wound finally healed by itself, but it left a big scar on his forehead. Soon afterwards, there was a famine in the country, and he decided to leave his place and travel to another part of the country. On his way, he joined a group of people, who served at the royal household. Along with them, he started serving at the royal household. One day, the king noticed the big scar on his forehead and thought, "This man must be a great warrior. The scar on his forehead is evident that he has received such wound in some battle. He must be very brave." Thus, the king promoted him as a warrior and he was honoured with a place amongst the best warriors of the kingdom.The other household workers knew that he was no warrior, and became jealous of the fact that the king favoured him, although he did not deserve it rightly. Soonafter, a battle was impending and the king summoned all his warriors. He wanted to speak to all the great warriors personally and gift them with precious items as an encouragement. The king addressed the soldiers with encouraging words and inspected the equipments, and weapons, and even the elephants and horses. On the other hand, the potter was no real warrior, and he feared going into the battleground. All the preparations for battle made him tense. But he was resolved to prove himself as a warrior in the battleground. While inspecting, the king noticed the potter. He took him aside and asked, "O Warrior, fighting which battle did you get this deadly scar?" The potter replied, "O king, this scar was not caused by any wound by any sword. Being a potter by profession myself, my home was full of pots. One night, I tripped after drinking more than I should have, I tripped over them that caused this wound. Due to improper attention, the wound left this big scar." When the king heard the truth, he felt embarrassed for his earlier decision. He asked his soldiers, "He is a potter, who has deceived me by pretending to be a warrior. Drive him away from the army!" The potter fell on his knees, and pleaded to the king, "O King, please do not do this. Have mercy on me, for I am sure I will be able to prove my bravery on the battleground. Please give me a chance to prove my worth." The king replied, "You may have excellent qualities, and you may be brave. But you do not possess the qualities required on the battleground. When the other warriors will come to know that you are only a potter, they will ridicule you. You will get yourself killed on the battleground! It is better if you leave, and return to your home."

From the top of the tree, the bird discharged its droppings, which fell near the hunter, and turned into gold. He was wonder-struck. The hunter thought, "All these years I have been catching birds, but I have never heard of a bird\'s droppings turn into gold. This is a special bird, which I will have to catch!" He set up a trap on the tree, which the bird did not notice and he was caught. The hunter, who was waiting nearby, immediately put him in a cage and started homewards. On the other hand, the bird repented that he was careless, not to notice the trap. On his way, he thought, "If I keep this bird, I will become rich, and everyone will be suspicious. Someday, someone will come to know the truth of the riches, and the bird, and report it to the king. I rather present the bird to the king, and be content with whatever he offers me in return." SO, he went straight to the palace and told the king everything. He gifted the bird to the king. The king was delighted to have a bird whose droppings turned into gold, and asked his attendants to treat the bird as the royal bird, "Take proper care of this bird.

How can you trust this mere hunter who is not knowledgeable? I advise you to release the cage and let the bird go. As for the hunter, please punish him for forgery." The king pondered over the words of his trusted and knowledgeable minister, and asked his guards to arrest the hunter and release the bird. No sooner had the bird freed, it flew up and perched himself at the top of a nearby gate. He discharged his droppings, which to the amazement of the king and his ministers, turned into gold. Realizing he had made a mistake, the king ordered his guards to catch the bird. But the bird was already free, he promised himself not to be careless again, and flew off where nobody can catch her again. ', 'There was a special '),

At sunset, whatever animal lives here is bound to return. I shall hide inside the cave and wait for my dinner to arrive." The cave was the home to a jackal, who arrived a while after the lion had hidden himself inside. While entering he noticed the footprints of the lion leading into the cave, but could not find any footprint coming out. He thought, "If a lion is indeed entered, I will be dead as soon as I enter. But, how can I be sure? There is no reason for me to stay away from my home if there is no lion inside. I must find out a way to confirm if the lion is still inside." The jackal thought of a plan, and standing in front of the cave, began to shout, "Hello Cave! Hello Cave! Can I come inside?" For some moment, he waited in silence and shouted again, "Hello Cave! Have you forgotten our understanding of all these years? I always wait for your reply before I enter. Why are you silent today? I shall then go to some other cave if you do not reply." On hearing this, the lion thought, "The cave must reply to the jackal when he returns at sunset. It is because I am inside that the cave is not replying today. I must invite on behalf of the cave, or the jackal will go away." So, the lion replied from inside the cave, "Hello Jackal, you may enter. It is safe inside." The reply was even more frightening due to the echo from the walls of the cave. The jackal at once knew that the lion was waiting for him to enter and make a meal out of him. He ran off, as fast as he could and saved himself. ', 'Kharanakhara was a lion '),
(373, 197, 3, 'Mandavisarpini was a white flea. She lived in the folds of the exquisite white silk sheet that covered the bed of a king in a certain country. She fed on the king\'s blood without anybody noticing, and was happy to spend her days. One day, a bug managed to enter the beautifully decorated bedroom of the king. When the flea saw him, she warned, "O Bug, what are you doing in the king\'s bedroom. Leave at once before you get caught!" The bug replied, "Madam, even if I were a good-for-nothing bug, that is no way to treat a guest. One should welcome a guest with humble words, sweet behaviour and offer refreshments" The bug continued, "I have fed myself with all types of blood, but never have I had the pleasure of the blood of a king. It must be very sweet, for the king eats the choicest of food. I would love to taste the king\'s blood, if you permit." The flea was taken aback, "O Bug, you have a nasty bite, like a sharp needle. Besides, I feed on the king\'s blood only when he is deep into his sleep. I can permit you to feed on the king\'s blood only if you promise to wait till he is asleep." The bug agreed, "I promise to wait till the king is asleep, and only after you have fed yourself, will I feed myself on his blood." Soon after they decided on such terms, the king came to his bedroom and lay down to sleep. The bug could not control himself, and decided to take a tiny bite of the king, without waiting. As the king was yet to fall asleep, he jumped at the sharp bite of the bug. The king shouted at his servants, "Hey, there is something in my bed that has bitten me. Look for it, as I have already been bitten." On hearing this, the bug quickly hid himself in a corner of the bed, before the servants could start searching for him. However, the servants scrutinized the entire bed, sheet by sheet, and found the flea between the folds. They killed her at once, and the king went to sleep without anymore worries.', 'Mandavisarpini was a white ');
